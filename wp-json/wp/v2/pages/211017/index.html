I\u2019m Lindsey Kilbride.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[clips from previous episodes]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>[Ron Kivett:]<\/strong><br \/>\"The ball rolled from the center of the table, all the way to the edge and stopped.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:]<\/strong><br \/> About the best description is that it\u2019s a giant gyroscope.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]<\/strong><br \/>After a while people will say you\u2019re crazy or this or that, which she is not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Nyah:]<\/strong><br \/>\"This definitely seems like the kind of place that could trigger supernatural thoughts.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Skeptoid podcast:]<\/strong><br \/>that\u2019s a common industrial steel and it\u2019s probably not likely to be something that aliens would use<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]<\/strong><br \/>Hynek reached out. He wanted them to come to Chicago and because they were unable to fly with the sphere, she said \"no, if you want to see this sphere, you're gonna have to come to us.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>I\u2019ve mentioned quite a few times now, the Navy investigated the ball and tried to figure out what it was. Gerri Betz allowed them to take the ball under the condition it\u2019s to be returned in no later than two weeks if it\u2019s not government property. A Navy spokesman initially told reporters, there\u2019s certainly something weird about the ball, but when he ended up returning it to the Betz family, seemed pretty uninterested. He said it was made out of stainless steel and from Earth, although the Navy couldn\u2019t figure out exactly where it came from or what it would have been used for. They wanted to cut the ball open, but Gerri said no.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also Gerri\u2019s claim the Navy tried to take the ball back when returning it to the Betzes\u2019 home...which doesn't really line up with the officer\u2019s nonchalant attitude about the ball to reporters.<\/p>\n<p>But this probe, although the most official \u2014 being the government \u2014 wasn\u2019t even close to the end of inquiry into the sphere\u2019s origin. So what did others find? And is it possible the Navy was wrong or not truthful?<\/p>\n<p>Early on, Gerri told reporters a UFO research group came to Florida to examine the ball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[News reporter:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Who have you talked to so far?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Gerri:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Well we talked to a group of people called NICAP. \u2018NYE-cap\u2019 I think is the way they pronounce the name of the organization.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>Gerri is talking about NICAP, an acronym for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Jerry Clark, that UFO expert who wrote the encyclopedia,<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Which is kind of considered the definitive reference work on this subject.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>He wrote quite a bit about NICAP, a citizen-led UFO research group, whose members ranged from scientists to clergymen. It was founded in the mid-50s, and Clark described the group as a sober and responsible forum for UFO investigation. In other words, members distanced themselves from the more fringe UFO claims like abduction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:]\u00a0<\/strong><strong>[from an archive tape]<\/strong><br \/>\"They came out and examined the ball and they said it was very precision made. It has a magnetic pole on it. One side repels, and the other side attracts. It has a hollow core.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>This is kind of hard to understand, but luckily NICAP published its findings in the May \u201874 edition of its monthly newsletter, The UFO Investigator, headlined \"Mysterious Steel Sphere Explained.\"<\/p>\n<p>Many details in this report aren\u2019t new to me because they\u2019d already been reported in newspapers, so very quickly:<\/p>\n<p>The ball was x-rayed at the Cecil Field Navy Station, but the machine used wasn\u2019t powerful enough to penetrate the sphere so it was then taken to another station in Jacksonville for the more powerful x-ray, which was successful.<\/p>\n<p>The sphere was beat up, like it had been rolled on concrete and had a small triangular chip out of the side. The ball was magnetic and perfectly balanced.<\/p>\n<p>The investigation was led by a mechanical engineer, and he ended up agreeing with the popular theory it was probably part of a valve used in machines at the paper plant. The plant\u2019s spokesman had said balls just like the Betzses\u2019 had been discarded by the plant 15 years before, and they could have ended up anywhere, including on the Betzes\u2019 property I guess.<\/p>\n<p>The report concluded the ball\u2019s odd rolling was due to uneven floors at the Betz house, attributing that theory to the Navy\u2019s spokesman.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the NICAP report credits the Navy\u2019s findings, but with much more detail than what I\u2019ve seen in the news reports. The actual Navy report is nowhere to be found. I submitted numerous public records requests to government agencies and archival departments and they were all unable to find anything. So right now this is the best I\u2019ve got.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s new to me:<\/p>\n<p>In addition to an x-ray taken by a more powerful machine, an emission spectrographic analysis identified the material of the sphere to be stainless steel 431. So now we know the methods they used, but not a lot about how they work.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily Florida State University geochemistry Professor Munir Humayun does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]<\/strong><br \/>\"My expertise is in the study of extraterrestrial materials, particularly in metals from extraterrestrial materials and our analysis.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>He told me this type of analysis is a way of determining the chemical composition of an object. So for this ball it would have analyzed the exterior and revealed OK, this is stainless steel. I also wanted to know more about these magnetic poles, referenced in articles, which either describe the ball as have 3 or 4 of them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]<\/strong>\"It means it's seen a couple of different magnetic fields. It\u2019s been exposed to some magnetic fields, and it's picked up that magnetism. Some of it would have picked up when you melted the sphere and formed it because it would form in the Earth's magnetic field. And so it will carry a little bit of a memory of the Earth's magnetic field. But if it's exposed to anything, this is a real problem for us, when we study magnetic fields and, say, iron meteorites. People who want to check whether they're truly iron attach a magnet to them. And every time somebody puts a magnet on a piece of metal, it acquires a little bit of that magnetic field...it's very weak.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>\"And so is it odd that the sphere would have these magnetic poles?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I bet somebody walked up to it and stuck a magnet on it.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>So in other words, multiple magnetic fields means it could have just been touched by magnets.<\/p>\n<p>The report goes on to say the x-ray determined the sphere to be uniformly hollow with three little balls inside. One, an eighth of an inch, and two of them even tinier. Spherical specks really. There was also a small amount of powdered residue inside \u2014 possibly sand, the scientist speculates.<\/p>\n<p>Then the Navy took an ultrasonic measurement which Humayun says bounces high-frequency waves into the ball. That would tell scientists the thickness of the ball\u2019s shell \u2014 about a half-inch \u2014 and the report gives more exact measurements of the ball. The diameter: 7.9 inches, and weight: 21.3 lbs.<\/p>\n<p>It says the ball also had a plug welded into the side a fourth of an inch wide, ground off and polished.<\/p>\n<p>But I have to say some parts of this report just make me question how well the writer or investigator knew the story. On one hand Gerri does characterize NICAP\u2019s work as \"an investigation.\" But the way this report is written, it makes me wonder, did they even touch the ball or just cite the Navy? All the conclusions are based on the Navy\u2019s findings. The first paragraph says the ball was found in the Betzes\u2019 backyard, but it was actually found on property miles from the home. It also spelled Gerri\u2019s name wrong. A lot of articles have these errors, but this person supposedly did an investigation. Seems kind of odd to me.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s this so-called researcher Carl Williston or Wilson? I\u2019m not sure because it\u2019s spelled differently in various articles, and I can find absolutely no record of him or this Omega Minus One research firm he supposedly worked for. I even ran his name and firm by Jerry Clark.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Do you know someone by the name of Carl Wilson or Williston from the Omega Minus One Institute out of Baton Rouge? Does that ring a bell of something that existed?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>\"No.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>And he knows a lot of people in the UFO research community. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say most. But in early news stories Gerri Betz says this guy Carl came to Florida and examined the ball for six hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I found radio waves coming from it and a magnetic field around it.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>Some of the scientists are dead now, so we\u2019re gonna hear them played by actors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I was unable to determine a pattern in the sphere\u2019s movement.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>There\u2019s also this 2012 blog write-up online which says Willson suggested:<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"The metal that made up the shell of the orb contained an unknown element making it slightly different than stainless steel.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>But I could not find the source of that anywhere. I also messaged the writer on Twitter. Did not hear back. So, Carl?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Yes.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>Sorry, but I have to take your findings with a grain of salt because I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re real. So I\u2019m going to set this one aside for now.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t doubt someone by this name researched the ball, but I can\u2019t really vet this claim if I don't know who made it.<\/p>\n<p>Around this time \u2014 remember, all these investigations happen within days or a week of each other in April of 1974 \u2014 the ball was taken to New Orleans where the National Enquirer\u2019s five-member blue ribbon UFO panel of scientists investigated the sphere: an astronomer, a civil engineer, philosophy professor, a plant physiologist and psychologist, Leo Sprinkle\u2026 Who...remembers nothing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]<\/strong><br \/>\"It's a beautiful case, I'm sorry that I can't contribute anything to it.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>And unfortunately there are very few Betz sphere-related articles published after the panel looked at it. Like, no one big report outlining the panel\u2019s findings or what members did to the ball. The best I\u2019ve got in an Associated Press article published one day after the panel. \"Five scientists intently watched a mysterious sphere for several hours Saturday, but it refused to perform.\" One scientist, James Harder, said they hadn\u2019t been able to establish any unusual movements, and he\u2019d like to cut it open. His colleague Robert Creegan said it may have come from Cape Canaveral. \u2018I\u2019m not sure what to make out of this, other than it doesn\u2019t seem like the ball was remarkable.\u2019 But, another colleague, J. Allen Hynek, the astronomer, and eventually \u2014<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>\"The most famous UFO proponent in the world\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>The same guy who allegedly slept with the ball in his room, he appeared on a Seattle radio show a day after returning from the New Orleans conference, this is before he allegedly visited the ball at the Betz home. And I have the tape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio show sound:]<\/strong><br \/><strong>[Host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Professor Hynek returned yesterday from New Orleans after sharing observations with colleagues regarding the so-called \u2018mystery sphere.\u2019 That sphere discovered a few weeks past by Terry Matthews, near Jacksonville, Florida. Let me ask you, first, Professor Hynek, about your latest evaluations of the sphere. Do you consider this now extraterrestrial or Earth manufactured?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>No, there's no evidence whatsoever that either I or the other members of the UFO panel can find that would indicate that it is extraterrestrial. That doesn't, of course, absolutely prove it isn't, but there is no obvious evidence. For instance, if it had come in from outer space, it undoubtedly would have had some sort of that ablation or burn marks on it, and it seems like a perfectly normal metal sphere.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I see. If that is true, then why hasn't someone stepped forward to, to make claim?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>Well, I wonder that very same thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Host:]<\/strong><br \/>Do you have any theories about that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>Well, no, I'm very much wondering why it seems to me that if it were perfectly normal and natural, that somebody surely would have said, \u2018Well, I've got one like that in my garage,\u2019 or, \u2018Our company makes two of those a week\u2019 or something like that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>We, of course, know now, those exact things did happen. A woman said she had a ball like the Betzes\u2019 in her garage, and the paper plant said the ball was likely part of one of its machines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Seattle radio host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Professor Hynek, when I left the story on Saturday, I was told that the sphere was considered solid. However, three balls on the inside, I believe they were called balls, were believed to be there and that they were embedded in the material. Ahat's the latest on that?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/> \"Well, the thing is definitely not hollow, at least not largely hollow. There might be some spaces in it because when you shake it, something inside definitely rattled, but the x-ray shows, indicates that there's no sharp line of demarcation between the shell and anything on the inside\u2026\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Some of that tape is breaking up. But I need to stop here because Hynek is saying, while the ball isn\u2019t solid stainless steel \u2014 that would make it way too heavy and dense \u2014 he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s largely hollow. In an article that day, he said the x-ray shows the little pellets inside are possibly suspended in a liquid. But the Navy said it was hollow, aside from the tiny balls inside\u2026And remember Hynek is a real scientist. At this point he\u2019s directing Northwestern University\u2019s Astronomical research center and chairing the astronomy department. So can this really be up for debate, whether the ball is or isn\u2019t hollow? Could the Navy be wrong?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I think based on this image, you really can\u2019t tell.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Dr. Diane Johnson is a diagnostic radiologist at Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville and she spends a lot of time looking at scans, mostly of humans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Mammograms, CT scans, ultrasound, plain x rays, and MRI exams.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Hynek\u2019s logic behind questioning whether the Betz sphere is largely hollow, is the way the x-ray looks. So I sent Dr. Johnson a copy. Now, this copy has been published by the Ancient Aliens TV show and the Astonishing Legends podcast. It looks like this: a light grey circle with hazy edges, and the three little balls inside are much darker than their surroundings. Two look like perfect spheres, and one the other looks like it\u2019s been squashed almost. Hynek says since there\u2019s not a clear distinction between the shell and whatever is inside, there must be something in there other than air.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong><br \/>\"t's probably a photograph of a copy of an x-ray is my best guess. My first impression is that it clearly looks old, so old, and in such that it's an old picture, but also old in that it looks like it's old technology to obtain that image.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>And she said, it\u2019s true, from this picture alone, you can\u2019t tell if the ball is hollow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong><br \/>\"It's a sphere, so you're taking a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional structure. And that's going to make it a little bit difficult to see the- the outer shell interface with the inner substance, presumably air if it's hollow. And the other factor is the resolution of the image itself. It's just not good enough to be able to see that interface. And if the shell around the outside is very thin, you wouldn't necessarily see it anyway. Basically, with x-rays, we're looking at differences in density. And that\u2019s what allows us to see images. So if you think about the chest x-ray that you always see on medical shows, you see the heart, you see the bones, and you see fat, and air. And so all of those things are different densities on x-ray. And that\u2019s why you can see those different images. If you put a completely fat density object next to another completely fat density object, you wouldn't see anything on the x-ray. You have to have objects next to each other that have differences in density.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>But her best guess?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong>\"It\u2019s very likely hollow. That would be my opinion.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Because ultrasonic measurements did establish a wall thickness, and when you shake it, you can hear the balls rattling around. As a confusing little twist: Although Hynek said the sphere wasn\u2019t largely hollow, in a later article Hynek does refer to the ball as being hollow, along with one of his colleagues on the UFO panel.<\/p>\n<p>I asked FSU Professor Humayun the same thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]<\/strong>We don't know what else is inside of it. It could be air, but it could be something else, or probably not. Yeah, it could be anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Except something like liquid mercury, which would show up on the x-ray. Of course, scientists in 1974 probably had the actual x-rays, not a washed-out photocopy. But we don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s in the ball. And I want to point in later articles, Hynek changes his opinion and says the ball IS hollow.<\/p>\n<p>This makes figuring out what the ball is so tough. Based on the little science we have, we know so little. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it. We have conflicting reports about if it even did, in fact, move oddly. And we have all these theories: it\u2019s part of a valve, it was going to be part of a sculpture. But the Betz ball was never (at least not publicly) side-by-side compared and contrasted with the any of the items.<\/p>\n<p>Back to Hynek.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Professor Hynek, given that it\u2019s man-made, how do we account here for the orbiting of the sphere?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>Well, I think we have concluded that\u2019s largely of a little bit of wishful thinking. Certainly did not behave that way when my colleagues and I examined it. In fact, I had to keep it from rolling off the table several times.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I don't understand. In other words, it did move but it did not orbit? Did it move of its own accord?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>\"No, no. It only moved when you moved it yourself. And, of course, one thing it does, is it is fairly heavy as it moves along, it unbalances the table. It presses down a little bit. And if might seem, if a table weren't completely level, it might seem to be moving by itself. But that is not the part that intrigues me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Host:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Would you tell me what part does?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>\"The fact that several witnesses had said that when the dog was brought near it to be photographed along with, the dog rolled over and put its paws over its ears, as though it heard sounds coming out not audible to our ears but audible to a dog's ears.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>So Hynek doesn\u2019t seem too impressed with the ball and believes it\u2019s from Earth. But he is interested in the claim that the Betzes\u2019 toy poodle would whimper and cover her ears around the sphere. That\u2019s also what the FSU geochemistry professor told me he was most interested in. Hynek goes on to say the ball should be coming to Northwestern, where he works, in about a week. And he had several tests planned.<\/p>\n<p>But the ball never made it up there. The Betz family says Hynek instead came to their house.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]<\/strong><br \/>\"He wanted them to come to Chicago. He said, \u2018No, if you want to see this sphere, you're gonna have to come to us.\u2019 So he came.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Reminder, that\u2019s Nan, the magazine editor who recently had a phone call with Gerri. But this is confusing for me because Hynek doesn\u2019t seem to back that up publicly, or at least he didn\u2019t seven months later when interviewed in an Indiana newspaper.<\/p>\n<p>In this story, Gerri Betz is quoted saying the tests run thus far indicate the ball is probably man-made \u2014 so she agrees with the Navy on that \u2014 but she still wants to know what it is.<\/p>\n<p>Her son Terry, who found the ball, is quoted saying the state of Florida is trying to claim it. First time I\u2019ve heard this, but I think I\u2019m now totally desensitized to a lot of the more outrageous allegations.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s Hynek\u2019s interview. He said he examined the thing just one time at the New Orleans UFO conference. We just heard his interview about that. Afterward, the family didn\u2019t send the ball to him so he lost all interest in it. He actually seems kind of annoyed in the article.<\/p>\n<p>He said he wasn\u2019t able to spend enough time examining it at the conference but doubled-down: The ball is man-made. He added he would examine the ball if it was sent to him.<\/p>\n<p>The story says the ball hadn\u2019t been cut open because the Betzes want Hynek to examine it first. And I really love this part of the article: Hynek is quoted saying he wants to be there when it happens, when the ball is cut open, saying it could go like this: <strong>[dream music]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\"Doctor, hand me the cutting torch. Stand back, everybody, because I don\u2019t really know what will happen.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>The ball is open. A little orange man about 6 inches tall steps out, looks around and says, \"Goorfie, snall gank splort popsem! Translation: \"Smile, you\u2019re on candid camera.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>I\u2019m not kidding.

Most of them come from James Harder, a civil and hydraulic engineer from Berkeley. He was also a member of the National Enquirer\u2019s blue ribbon UFO panel, along with Hynek and Sprinkle, which investigated the ball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"The ball seems to have some remarkable properties.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Again, this is an actor saying Harder\u2019s paraphrased and actual quotes about the ball.<\/p>\n<p>More than a year and a half after the panel he was a part of examined the Betz ball, Harder was quoted in an article headlined \"Experts Disagree on Florida Sphere Origin.\"<\/p>\n<p>While Hynek said publicly the ball wasn\u2019t remarkable, his colleague Harder said:<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I found the thing to be in perfect balance in a way I would not have expected it to be. The results of the x-rays taken on the thing were not what you\u2019d expect them to be.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Will you elaborate on that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder:]<\/strong><br \/>\"No, no.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Huh, OK.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"I don\u2019t see how Dr. Hynek could be sure whether it is man-made or not without running further tests. There hasn't been enough research done on the thing to declare it to be man-made or otherwise. And I can\u2019t understand why Dr. Hynek\u2019s so interested in the thing if he thinks it isn\u2019t UFO-related.\" Mrs. Betz told me that Dr. Hynek noticed the dead trees around the area where the sphere was found but i think it would be interesting to discover if he is about about admit to those trees.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>OK, so Harder is saying there were dead trees in the area where the ball was found, which was not in any other articles I read about the sphere and Gerri did not mention that in her interview with Ron the radio host.<\/p>\n<p>But Hynek addressed this in the article, saying he did see the dead trees (so I\u2019m going to go with it\u2019s true) but he doesn't think it\u2019s possible to relate dead trees to the finding of the ball.<\/p>\n<p>This article was published a year and half after Harder studied it along with Hynek and other colleagues in New Orleans, And now Gerri Betz is saying she wants Harder to examine it again, because he has more experience in the field of engineering than Hynek and she wants to make an agreement to have a member of her family present at the research sessions.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like she now doesn\u2019t trust anyone else to be alone with it.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s where things get weirder. Harder\u2019s alleged comments get printed in this giant book I ordered, the Encyclopedia of UFOs \u2014 different than Clark\u2019s multi-volume UFO Encyclopedia). This book is by a guy named Ronald Story, and there\u2019s a section on the Betz sphere and even a photo of Terry, Gerri\u2019s son who found the sphere, holding the ball with a National Enquirer Blue Ribbon Panel banner behind him. He\u2019s 21, a kid with a plaid shirt, wavy long hair, big wire-frame glasses and a mustache. Basically a hipster today.<\/p>\n<p>The book, published in 1980, says Harder found the ball exhibits four magnetic poles, which lines up with most news reports, that the ball either had three or four of them. And that\u2019s not that weird according to FSU Professor Humayun.<\/p>\n<p>But the book says Harder claims the x-ray shows those little balls inside the sphere are more dense than the shell. So in other words not just pieces of the shell that fell inside during manufacturing, something else, a different material.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Thus a substantial portion of the weight is in the internal material and the shell could be much thinner than a half-inch.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Can the shell\u2019s thickness be debatable? According to the NICAP report, which looks like it mostly just copies the Navy\u2019s report, ultrasonic measurements established the wall thickness to be a half-inch with a tiny margin of error, within a hundredth of an inch. But, if that were true, the ball would actually be about 3 lbs heavier.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>\"It really depends on, how valid are all these measurements?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>That\u2019s a mechanical engineer who I happen to know really well. He\u2019s my brother Sean. I called him to ask, how big of a deal is this shell thickness discrepancy?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>\"We\u2019re saying it\u2019s exactly a half an inch, but we don\u2019t know if anyone is rounding there. The thickness is really important because whenever you\u2019re doing a volume calculation, the formula for volume is the radius to the third power. If they\u2019re rounding anywhere there, that error get propagated throughout that equation, and it could be off by a larger amount. So if anyone is off by any of their measurements, then that could totally mess up our estimation.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Also, the report said an emission spectrographic analysis was used to determine the outside of the ball was stainless steel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]<\/strong>\"The other thing we don\u2019t know is how close the steel is to the specifications. So basically if that steel is exactly grade 431 steel, we know what the density should be, but if the mixture is off a little bit or if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s been done to it to change the chemical composition, then it might not be the same as the density that\u2019s published. We don\u2019t know how close it is to your ideal steel of that type.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Remember, this report is from a nonprofit UFO research group. It happens to cite more details from the Navy than I\u2019d seen anywhere else. But it\u2019s not the official Navy report and we don\u2019t have the details from that metal analysis, so we can\u2019t say this is 100% accurate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]<\/strong>Whenever you do the calculation, it\u2019s about 15 percent off from what it should be. We don\u2019t know exactly how accurate those measurements are, so it\u2019s not something I\u2019d be super concerned with.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>So maybe Harder has something, or maybe there was just some rounding in the report, but Harder is also quoted saying the little balls inside the sphere are more dense than the shell. They do look much darker than the rest of the ball. Does the x-ray actually prove that? Radiologist Diane Johnson again:<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>[Diane Johnson:]<\/strong><br \/><\/strong>\"It's difficult because it's a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional structure. But it does look like those are separate and potentially higher in density. Although you can't really say that for sure because they could be thicker, made of the same material. You know, for example, they could be a solid stainless steel little metal ball versus a stainless steel shell. It's hard to say just based on that one image.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>I asked FSU professor Humayun the same question:<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>\"Would it be wrong for people to assume that just in making the sphere that little pieces of the shell just, you know, while making it they just kind of fell down?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]<\/strong>\"Yeah, those don't look like, they look like little spheres. They look quite deliberate within there. They don't look like broken fragments of the shell.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Wow, so this makes me entertain Harder\u2019s comments much more than I had previously.<\/p>\n<p>I think we can safely say the ball is hollow and the shell is stainless steel 431, but the inside, it\u2019s kind of a mystery.<\/p>\n<p>However, that\u2019s not all this book said Harder found. It says he spoke before the International UFO Congress in 1977 (Basically a convention for UFO people). That\u2019s about three years after the sphere was found. \u2018Dr Harder presented his truly astounding recent findings on the sphere.\u2019 (So this is essentially confirming he did reexamine the ball, like he said he wanted to in the article a year and a half before.) He asserted, based on his x-rays, that the two internal spheres<\/p>\n<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Are made of elements far heavier than anything known to science. The Betz sphere contains elements having atomic numbers higher than 140. The heaviest element yet produced in any atomic reactor here on Earth has an atomic number of 105. If one were to drill into the sphere perhaps one of the masses would go critical and explode like an atomic bomb.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>While Hynek says the ball is nothing special, Harder is apparently here saying this is like nothing we\u2019ve seen on Earth. So while I think Hynek could be onto something with the densities, I don\u2019t know how seriously to take this book. Here\u2019s why: This book seems to be the source for these claims, like I can\u2019t find another article or book where he\u2019s making such extreme declarations. Every modern write-up about the ball quotes this book. So I did a little more digging and actually found a book titled Proceedings of the First International UFO Congress 1977, same year. Harder is in this book a lot. He gave a talk on the hard evidence for UFOs, no mention of the Betz ball. He\u2019s part of a panel discussion along with Leo Sprinkle, who you heard earlier, and Hynek, about if people who have more than one UFO experience should be taken seriously. But there\u2019s no mention of this speech about the sphere that the UFO encyclopedia excerpt says he gave at the conference. Granted, this book is just the best-of lectures. One of the editors of the book was Jerry Clark, the UFO expert. He attended the conference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>I have no memory of hearing anything like that. You know I was involved in the organization of it. When that conference was going on, I was running around a lot, but I did participate in some of the sub-conferences where people who were speaking there got together and batted around ideas and.. now, it's possible, you know, that that he said something, but I just, you know, I just don't remember. This whole episode came and went without making much of an impression on anybody because I don't see it in the literature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>There\u2019s no mention of the Betz sphere in his giant encyclopedia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>\"And I spent an enormous amount of time reading UFO literature, including official documents and old UFO publications from the 50s and 60s, and as many books as I could get my hands on. Now, if it had really been with Harder says it was, it certainly would have made an impression, and it would be something like proof of some kind of, you know, otherworldly visitations. That clearly wasn't that, whatever it was.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>\"I kind of just want to get a feel for, you know, who Harder was and sort of how different he was from Hynek.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]<\/strong><br \/>\"You know, there's a certain kind of person you run into if you're around this field and you meet people. You know, people who have impressive professional educational credentials. You're glad that they decided to look into this question because we certainly need that kind of expertise. We\u2019re trying to understand what's going on. But sometimes, you find that people who in their ordinary lives are capable scientists and professionals, kind of throw that all out the window when they look at UFOs. This is like they have some kind of metaphysical itch they want to scratch with UFOs and then they just get in and they\u2019re just other crazy people. And there's no shortage of them as it is. And that was my \u2014 don't quote me because this is just based upon things that picked up over the years \u2014 but I was never impressed with Harder.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>So Clark thought Harder wasn\u2019t skeptical enough, but also admits he didn\u2019t know him personally.<\/p>\n<p>Leo Sprinkle, the member of the blue ribbon panel we talked to earlier, he knew Harder a bit better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]<\/strong><br \/>Dr. Jim Harder, he was interested in the physical evidence. Some cases that had even photographs of flying saucers or whatever it is.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>Sprinkle himself studied more of the fringe UFO claims, the stuff organizations like NICAP distanced themselves from, including people who claimed to have had contact with extraterrestrials. Remember he is a psychologist and really interested in people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>\"How did you perceive Harder as a scientist looking into these claims?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Sprinkle:]<\/strong><br \/>You know, I perceived him as very bright, very capable, emphasizing the physical science aspect, more than that social science aspect. Whereas I think Hynek was very interested in both. But I appreciate Jim Harder\u2019s approach because he was careful in trying to determine what is called normal, physically tired, what is unusual, physical aspects of flying saucers and people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>So, two totally different opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Now I want to play a part of Hynek\u2019s radio interview that stuck out to me. The host asks him about the death of a man who used to write about UFOs, and he immediately seems to shoot down a rumor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio host:]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\"I want to ask you, what do you think of is it Frank Edwards? Does he hold weight, in your opinion?<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>He's been deceased.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio host:]<\/strong>I understand that, under mysterious circumstances,<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>No, heart attack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Radio host:]<\/strong>Oh, someone told me otherwise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>No, I don't think so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>To me, Hynek sounds like someone who doesn't buy into conspiracies, even as someone who spent his later life looking into UFOs.<\/p>\n<p>But something else stood out to me when I was researching all this. I mentioned to Leo Sprinkle, Hynek\u2019s former colleague on the National Enquirer panel, that Hynek said this about the ball\u2019s odd movements:<\/p>\n<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]<\/strong><br \/>\"Well, I think we have concluded it largely is a little bit of wishful thinking.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong>And that's totally opposite of what the family says happened at the conference. So I'm just sort of trying to sort through those two sides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]<\/strong>\"Strange because I usually perceived Allen Hynek as being not only sympathetic but willing to discuss with the witness or the families what they're experiencing. And that makes it sound like he was covering...like there was something he didn't want to talk about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[music]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I found Sprinkle\u2019s comment about Hynek really eerie\u2026I think something happened either with Harder or Hynek...Maybe it was that Harder believed the ball was something more remarkable than what everyone else had told Gerri Betz and she started believing it too, but maybe it was something else. Here\u2019s my case.<\/p>\n<p>Gerri is quoted about half a year after her son found the sphere, saying tests show it\u2019s most likely man-made, but that she still wants to know what it is...But then there\u2019s the later article in which Harder is arguing there\u2019s no proof it\u2019s man-made\u2026 and Gerri is quoted saying this: \"I believe there\u2019s evidence we have something from a UFO on our hands. There are circumstances surrounding the object that made me feel it has some properties that our scientists aren\u2019t familiar with.\" She was of the opinion the Navy was hiding something from the public for security reasons. \"They know more than they\u2019re saying,\" she said.<\/p>\n<p>So what happened? In that same later article Gerri says Hynek came to Florida and spent the day with her family the year before, and Hynek pleaded to take it with him but she refused. Hynek doesn\u2019t confirm in the article if he actually did go to the family\u2019s home.<\/p>\n<p>Nan, the magazine editor, had a little more insight. This is what Gerri told her happened around that period of time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]<\/strong>\"The sphere was never the same. And Gerri thinks that he swapped it out with a dummy.\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]<\/strong><br \/>\"You know, I recently read an article with Hynek's son because he because there's a new TV show called Blue Book based on Hynek's work and these UFO sightings. So Hynek's son is an advisor on the show. At the very last sentence of the article, he said, you know, he was talking about how they had all this stuff in their house, like a library of artifacts or whatever.
