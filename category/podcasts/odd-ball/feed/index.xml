<p>From WJCT Public Media in Jacksonville this is Episode 5, the season finale of <em>Odd Ball</em>. I’m Lindsey Kilbride. </p>
<p><strong>[clips from previous episodes]</strong></p>
<p>“We don’t know what else is inside of it. Yeah it could be anything.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“So you did bring up the fact that I want to talk to her.” </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“I did. She was like, you know, Nan, I just don't feel comfortable really sharing this with anyone.” </p>
<p>“That makes it sound like he was covering. Like there was something about it he didn’t want to talk about.” </p>
<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]</strong><br />“The ball went back and forth. They weren’t sure they got the right ball back.” </p>
<p>“Did it move of its own accord?” Hynek: “I think we have concluded that largely is a little bit of wishful thinking.” </p>
<p>One of the main reasons the Betz sphere caught so much interest in the 70s is because a lot of people, including Gerri Betz herself, speculated the ball might be from outer space. So as I near the end of my own inquiry into this mystery, I’d really like to know for sure: Is that even possible?</p>
<p>A lot of people have said the ball is definitely made on Earth because it’s stainless steel. Remember? Like Brian Dunning from the Skeptoid podcast:</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br /> “That’s a common industrial steel and it’s probably not likely to be something that aliens would use. So we can be pretty sure metallurgically that it’s something from some industrial plant right here on Earth.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But can we? The week the ball started making headlines, Gerri Betz asked two different news reporters: “Who could say what’s on another planet?” </p>
<p>And I have no idea. That’s why I brought back FSU geochemistry Professor Munir Humayun. </p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br /> “My expertise is in the study of extraterrestrial materials, particularly in metals from extraterrestrial materials and their analysis.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“So what do we know about what materials exist outside of Earth?”</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br /> “Well, if you're talking just natural materials, and you're not asking what have extraterrestrial civilizations come up with, then stainless steel is a very anthropogenic product, you do not find stainless steel falling from natural materials. The materials we find in space, including iron meteorites, have very distinct compositions and we can recognize them rather easily from the man-made products. Stainless Steel 431 is a very specific chemical composition and a very specific textural association. It would be remarkable if another civilization made a stainless steel that’s exactly like 431. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Say that, that did happen. What would have happened to the sphere if it would have dropped into Earth?</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br /> “Let's presume that for argument's sake, a spacecraft did not visit Earth and drop the sphere inadvertently, like a little space alien playing with our ball and left it behind on Earth. If it were roaming around in space, regardless of how it got there, it would be exposed to galactic cosmic rays. And so it would have a certain amount of radioactivity in it, which would have been detectable, if they had measured radioactivity very sensitively.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Gerri told reporters the Navy found the ball was NOT radioactive and NOT explosive. </p>
<p>But what about that scientist’s alleged comments that the little balls inside the sphere are made out of elements heavier than another known to science.  </p>
<p>Humayun’s assessment?</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br /> “Unlikely to be an element heavier than any known to humans, because a heavier metal would both increase the density beyond what we measure. And it would also be radioactive, incredibly radioactive. And so if there was a significant like a little sphere of some elements like Californium, or or any other transuranic, you would pick that up. You'd pick it up in the x-ray because it would come out really bright and shiny compared to the steel. And you would pick it up in the gamma rays, which probably was what they measured when they were looking for radioactivity.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />So if Navy did test for radioactivity and didn’t find anything, like the article said, that pretty much rules out Professor James Harder’s alleged comments that the ball contained elements heavier than anything found on Earth...BUT it doesn’t rule out the little balls inside were made of a different material than the outer shell. </p>
<p>Why does that matter? </p>
<p>The Navy’s explanation is the balls inside, they’re just little fragments of the shell that fell in during manufacturing. So maybe it was intentionally placed there for a purpose but maybe something else got in there. I don’t know. Of course, debris doesn’t make a ball vibrate and roll around weird. Gerri also said that it was almost like she could hear the little balls inside pinging around by themselves. Like something more was going on in there. But none of the scientists I spoke with had any theories.</p>
<p>Professor Humayun said nowadays there are beams that would be able to collect the atomic composition of the inside of the sphere. The theory he finds most compelling: </p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br /> “Somebody mentioned that this looked exactly like a pulp mill ball.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />NOO, not him too. Another one joins the paper plant theory club.</p>
<p>It’s been difficult to get scientists to participate in interviews about this because a lot of it is speculative.  I don’t have the official Navy report, (despite many many public records requests to governmental departs and archival departments. No one has been able to find anything.) If anyone out there listening does have it, I’d love to see it.  </p>
<p>One materials engineer who agreed to answer my questions by email says cutting the ball open would have pretty much answered all these questions. </p>
<p>The Navy had asked to cut it open, and Professor J. Allen Hynek talked about it cutting it open during that radio interview after he returned from the New Orleans National Enquirer panel. </p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek]</strong><br />“Of course we could cut the thing open and that would solve the whole thing probably.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong><br />"But it would ruin it for someone else." </p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />“It would, and it’s such a nice ball.”]
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But all signs point to, the ball really wasn’t anything special. Or we can’t prove it was.</p>
<p>I think UFO expert Jerry Clark said it best when he called the ball a blip in history, nothing more. </p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“If it had really been with Harder says it was, it certainly would have made an impression and it would be something like proof of some kind of, you know, otherworldly visitations. This clearly wasn't that, whatever it was.” </p>
<p>This is not what I want to hear. I ask Clark, what about all the weird allegations? The Navy’s trying to take the sphere back. Why would they want it if it wasn’t special? Terry’s being flown back to Florida and separated from the ball because his mom was supposedly sick, only to find out that was made up? What about its rolling uphill? What about all the witnesses who said the ball acted weird?</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“That's interesting. But you know, what are you going to do with that? You hear these stories, and there are stories where people claim that someone took their evidence. And if these stories are true in any way, they certainly have had no measurable influence on any observable government UFO policy.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He believes if the government really had all this proof, or a collection of UFOs, they’d be reverse engineered and we’d have a lot of new technologies we don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“These things are all taking place on the margins of society, and to the people who experienced them there, they may be life changing. I mean, they're extremely strange and upsetting and challenging. But they don't affect history. Life goes on.”</p>
<p><strong>[Music]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />After talking to Jerry Clark and all these scientists, I’d adopted this attitude too. And this is my mind set as I go into my next chat with Nan, the magazine editor who profiled Gerri Betz a couple years ago. She’s been talking with Gerri and said she’d ask her AGAIN on my behalf if there’s any way she’d consider talking for this podcast. </p>
<p>This is Gerri’s most recent email to Nan:</p>
<quote>
<p>Dear Nan, </p>
<p>We are out of town and don’t expect to be home anytime soon. I wish you and your family the best. </p>
<p>Sincerely, Gerri </p>
</quote>
<p>Nan says she feels like Gerri’s blowing her off. It does sound like that. So when I talked to Nan she was racking her brain, thinking, ‘Did I say something wrong?’ ‘Do something to upset her?’ and she even followed up with an apology to Gerri. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“I took that, for what it seemed to be like this, you know, I'm just not really interested in engaging. I don't, I don't blame her. I really, I want to respect her privacy, and in I way I feel like her last email is definitely her trying to establish a boundary from our previous exchanges. And so, yeah, just wanted to kind of let it sit a little while and then mull it. I do, I want to. But I also want to speak with her again. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Yeah, no, it's a bummer for sure.” </p>
<p>NK: “I know. I feel like I blew it.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“No!”</p>
<p>NK: :I feel like I totally blew it.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I called Nan on her cell instead of having her swing by the studio for better-quality sound because I thought this would be the extent of the conversation, just a little check-in...But we end up talking for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I fill her in about a lot of my research and conversations, like with Leo Sprinkle, the scientist on the UFO panel who doesn’t remember the sphere at all. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />That sounds kind of like pleading the fifth or something.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And the conversation I had with the UFO expert Jerry Clark, where he basically says no one in the UFO community cared about this ball. It was nothing special. Nan says, yeah, but the government does all kinds of secret stuff. And think about who Gerri is. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“There was no, like, need for her to kind of create this fiction around this object, to sensationalize something. I personally think that the Betz family — something happened during that time period that scared the Betz family into silence.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And just like that, I’m back again. Not sure what to believe, remembering Nan’s conversations with Gerri and all these weird things that happened with the ball, some I haven’t even shared with you yet.</p>
<p>Nan was the second person who has a direct relationship with Gerri to tell me Allen Hynek, from the UFO panel, came to Gerri’s home to examine the ball. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“Hynek reached out. He wanted them to come to Chicago and she said, ‘No, if you want to see this sphere, you're gonna have to come to us.’ So he came and she said that he was just a delightful person. They enjoyed their time together. He was only there for a couple days. He asked if he could bring the sphere into his bedroom overnight, and she didn't really see any harm in that. She trusted him. He was a government scientist with a very staunch reputation. I think Gerri just wanted to know what it was. That was her whole mission behind all of this, was just to find out what this thing was, so he spent the night with it and then he left the next day. She said that he came carrying an old-fashioned doctors bag. Like one of those large leather sacks. I think she just assumed it was full of tools or clothes or whatever. Then he left.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Some time after this, Nan says Gerri told her she took the ball to be x-rayed again because the ball had stopped rolling around and vibrating.                                                                      </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“I think she felt like there was something different about it and she wanted to be sure, and she was really surprised when the x-rays came back and they were different from the original ones that she had done prior to Dr. Hynek coming.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Did she say what was different about them?”</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“She did. She said that they were seams. There were actual seems on the sphere where in the original x-rays there were no seams of the…”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Like on the inside?” </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“She didn't specifically say.”  </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“But it looked different.”</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“Yeah.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I found an article in which Gerri actually addresses this. The date is cut off, but it’s definitely later on. She explains a lot of people are after the ball. She had to have a guy ordered off her property. Some firm offered her 750-grand for the ball. Then she says she had the ball x-rayed again and these did not match the Navy’s x-rays. The Betz sphere has three little balls inside. Two look perfectly round. And the third is bigger and not so round  — there’s a little line coming from it, which she calls an antenna. She says that ball was now pulverized. “I can’t even prove now it’s the same one we originally had,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“She was just furious. Then she...I think that anger changed to kind of the revelation that whatever the sphere was, the government did not want her to find out and not want her to know, and she decided, in that moment, to burn those x-rays. She did not feel comfortable with any sort of proof of that information.”</p>
[Music]
<p>Nan says the family knows where the ball is, it’s still around.</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />“They still have the ball that she feels like is not the ball.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But she doesn’t know WHO has it. Someone close to Gerri, who asked to remain anonymous, tells me, today she isn’t sure if it was swapped out or tampered with it...but the ball was never the same after all these investigators had their hands on it.</p>
<p>So we don’t have proof Hynek took the ball or tampered with it, and I want that to be clear. But let’s talk about how likely that could have been. Because if it’s true, it would make more sense as to why it seemed like so many people were after it. Because maybe it was something they weren’t supposed to have. </p>
<p>There’s also this weird new detail: One of Hynek’s son’s recently — as in this year  — was quoted in his hometown newspaper saying, growing up, his family had a metal ball from a Florida UFO case. </p>
[Music]
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Quick refresh: Hynek was contracted by the Air Force to figure out explanations for UFO sightings. After his work with the government he founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) near where he lived in Evanston, Illinois. It’s still around today and it’s where I got that old radio interview tape. </p>
<p>Jerry Clark, the UFO expert, was on the center’s board. Very small world, this UFO community.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“What was Hynek like?” </p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“Oh, he was a wonderful man. He always had a twinkle in his eye and pipe in his mouth and he was just fun. He was extremely smart and he was just sort of overwhelmed every living moment with, you know, scientific curiosity.”  </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“And so you said you knew him fairly well. How do you define that? I guess I'm just trying to gauge how much time you spent with him.” </p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“Oh, man. I don't know. Maybe see him once every week or two. Sometimes, we were at his...by we, I mean, I and fellow CUFOCs officers or sometimes just myself at his house in  Evanston, and I know his wife, and, I don't know, how do you know somebody, you know? He was a colleague, you know, a friendly colleague, and we were bonded. Same organization, the same goals.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I want to hear what Clark thinks about these rumors, that the sphere was different after Hynek left the Betzes or sometime around the National Enquirer UFO conference in New Orleans. I’ve heard and read both. And that Hynek supposedly had a similar ball in his home.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“The sphere apparently wasn't the same afterward. So they didn't know if he tampered with it or switched it out. So do you know if he ever would, you know, swipe artifacts that he was interested in or try to recreate them or anything like that?” </p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />“Well, let me answer it this way. Because I'm trying to just try to work this out of my memory. One thing is Allen really wanted was validation. That he really hoped before he died, that he would have the proof that UFOs exist. And this was really important to him, because he had taken a real hit from his colleagues. He had been a prominent and respected  astronomer till he went to the dark side. And so it was very important for Allen to find validation. So he wasn't above quietly grabbing a document of the official files, which is going to be burned or otherwise discarded, that he thought, this is, you know — I don't mean highly classified documents. Allen had a high security classification and he took it very seriously — but there was a lot of stuff that was...would have been interesting to somebody researching UFOs that, to the people around Allen, when he was working in his official capacity, just junk. And if there was a sphere in the house — which I never saw. And I was in that house on a number of occasions, and was never mentioned to me. And I never saw anything like that — but it would have been in the context of just picking up something that otherwise would have been discarded. He didn't even necessarily have to think that it was important in the context of documenting the existence of UFOs.  </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Do you think that if he did think that there was something to the sphere that you would have known that?”</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />:Yes, I think it would have been known to us at CUFOs, as an important item. </p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He said the center published a scientific journal and he believes if Hynek had the sphere, it would have been handed over to their scientists, and that never happened. </p>
<p>I reached out the center myself and heard back from its current director… He said “The Betz sphere was ultimately found not to be anything alien or paranormal” and he attached the NICAP report we dived into last episode: which concludes: the thing is probably from the paper mill. </p>
<p>I also reached out to a woman named Jennie Ziedman, one of Hynek’s old colleagues. She emailed me that she’s not familiar with the ball I described either.</p>
<p>So what was Hynek’s son talking about, growing up with a metal sphere from A FLORIDA UFO CASE? </p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“Well here’s what I know about that.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />After the break.</p>

<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Like his favorite, croissants, which take three-and-a-half days to make.</p>
<p><strong>[Adam:]</strong>[In the kitchen:] “That's where I roll all the croissants in all the butter. We do that first thing in the morning. [door opening] I bring the croissants up here to proof because this warm weather really pops up real good up here so yeah, This is a full breakfast croissant. It's got ham, eggs, bacon, cheese, herbs in it.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“And what day are these on?” Adam: “These are day three. So these will get baked here in several hours, once they're done proofing.”</p>

<p><em>What It’s Like</em> promo:<br /> <strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />If you like stories about regular people going through extraordinary circumstances — and I assume you do if you’re listening to <em>Odd Ball</em> — you might also want to check out another WJCT podcast that I’m really proud of, called “What It’s Like.” Each of the 8 episodes is basically a conversation between two people who went through something intense, together. <em>What It’s Like</em> is available wherever you get your podcasts. It’s the one with the purple background and white table and chairs on the logo. </p>
<p><strong>[music fades out]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Paul Hynek is an advisor on the TV show Project Blue Book, which is about his dad. </p>
<p><strong>[TV show trailer:]</strong><br /> A family reported seeing something falling from the sky. “I’ll be down there right away.” “I need you to meet someone first.” “The name’s Dr. Allen Hynek.” “You want me to investigate flying saucers?” “I want you to help me prove to the public the truth: they don’t exist.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He was recently quoted in an article about his role on the TV show and what it was like growing up with a dad really into UFOs. But this is the very last quote in the story: “I found out recently that a big silver sphere we had was from some famous UFO case in Florida. We would just kick it around on the floor because we didn’t know what it was.”</p>
<p>Whaaat? So I get him on the phone and rather than lead with this alleged ball theft, I ask him, what was your dad like? </p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“People talk about him, you know, changing from being a skeptic to a believer. I don't think believer’s really a good word for a scientist. I think he became an acceptor. That he accepted that there was a phenomena. He felt very strongly that you should keep your eyes open or your mind open when confronted with what may be a new phenomena, but then also to not close your mind too quickly, just availing yourself of the best answer that you have handy. Because the answer may be more difficult, and you need to be comfortable with questions that you can't answer, which is a large part of science.”</p>
<p>“He became convinced within a few years that there was something going on, because he and the Air Force couldn't explain all these cases, and if you look at Project Blue Book's official stats of some 12,000 cases that they investigated, and over 700 they couldn't explain. And this is with a clear mandate, as we see in the show, to explain them all away. And yet, they still couldn't.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“It seemed your Dad maybe disagreed with some of their public conclusions about the cases. Can you talk at all about that?”</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“My father felt that the Air Force’s job isn't science, it's national security. But while he was there, yes, there was friction and frustration. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“He said Project Blue Book, turned into more of public relations exercise to tamp down hysteria.” </p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“But he felt that his ability to help collect the information and guide how it’s collected and recorded was very valuable for his later analysis and discussion.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />OK, OK, I won’t keep you waiting any more. What about this Florida ball in his house?</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“Well, here's what I know about that. I spoke on a panel for [the] History [Channel] at Alien Con in Pasadena last year in the summer, and a woman came up to me after the panel and showed me a newspaper clipping with a picture of a sphere and said, "Do you know anything about this case?’ And I said, ‘I haven't heard about this case. But we had a big metallic sphere in our basement for years. And my brother and I had no idea where it came from, and we would just sort of kick it around the floor. I mean, it was like it was larger than a basketball, it was just big metallic sphere and we had no idea where it came from.’ And so I mentioned this to the woman, and then 10 minutes later after Googling on her phone, she came back and she said, ‘I think your father took possession of that sphere.’ So I can't confirm or deny if the sphere we saw was from that case, but I do know that woman was very excited and that we had a sphere in our house.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“And your dad didn't say where it was from ever?”</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“No because we had so many things at our house that it just sort of became normal for us. You know, we had this artistic rendering of Travis Walton being zapped by UFOs on the wall in our laundry room.”  </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“As you do.” </p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“Yeah, as one does. And Christmas ornaments that were UFOs on the tree, and things like that.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Wow. Yeah. So I read that you said that in a recent article, and there are comments that were like, "Maybe it's the Betz sphere," and then I also know that in the show, there's a plot point where your dad takes one of the artifacts, and I was like, is that based on a real occurrence?</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“Yes. Are you insinuating, Lindsay, that my father is some kind of UFO kleptomaniac?”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Not necessarily.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But yes.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“But that is...so there's a cult following around the sphere, right? And then once that, quote came out in the article, people are like, you know, maybe the sphere was switched out or maybe has it or maybe he made a duplicate of it. And so everyone's sort of inquiring, you know, what's going on with it?” </p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“Oh, well, you know, I can imagine a situation where if that was the case, let's just entertain the sort of, the kind of fun aspect of that. If this was that sphere, then I think my father probably did a good job not telling his gabby teenage sons where it came from.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I didn’t have Paul on the phone for long, so I followed-up with some emails. I ask him where that basement ball is today. He has no idea. I ask about the ball’s weight. The Betz sphere was more than 20 lbs. Paul said his dad’s sphere: really heavy. But he estimates his ball was a little bigger than a basketball. The Betz sphere would have actually been a little smaller, not by much. He doesn’t remember a triangular chip out of the side. </p>
<p>Then Paul reaches out to his brother, who reminds him their ball seemed hollow and made some kind of jingly noises when they rolled it...well, that sounds pretty familiar ... and they remembered there was some kind of mark on the outside. He described it as a manufacturing scar, “a seal where the molten metal was poured into a mold, perhaps,” he wrote.  But he followed up saying, “If you heard my dad say it wasn’t out of this world in an interview. I’d go with that.”</p>
<p>I’m not ready to just “go with that.” </p>
<p>So I reach out to one of Hynek’s other sons. He says if he remembers correctly, it was an industrial ball bearing, and his dad didn’t bring it home, a different brother did. He confirmed it was hollow and when you rolled it, something else moved around inside. Then he tells me, “I vaguely remember the ball ending up with one of my friends somehow.”</p>
<p>Then I asked if he’d mind following up with his brother, the one who maybe brought a giant ball bearing home, because if Hynek definitely didn’t bring this ball home, that’s a pretty big breakthrough. More than a month later, I get a reply. </p>
<p>“Finally got a hold of Joel (that’s the other brother). It turns out he is not the one that brought the sphere back home. He seems to remember that it was our dad who brought it home. Still a bit of a mystery. I also seem to remember that at one time there were actually two spheres, although Joel doesn’t seem to remember the second. We both agree that it was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>I ask if he knows where the ball is today and he says no, he thinks an old friend may have taken it, but the person he’d want to ask has passed away. </p>
[music swells and fades] </p>
<p>After all these interviews...I still haven’t talked to Gerri, and I’ve honestly been panicking because I don’t know if I can tell this story without her — or if I even want to. I really only wanted to do this project under that assumption. That’s the only way to do it right, right?</p>
<p>My coworker who works in a totally different department knew I was having trouble getting in touch with somebody, so a couple days later he dropped off some stationary on my desk and said “try writing her a letter.”</p>
<p>So I did… and I quickly realize I can’t remember the last time I’ve handwritten someone a letter. I have to Google what a cursive capital G looks like. Ultimately, decided against cursive if you’re wondering. This is what I write: </p>
<p>“I’m reaching out because over the past year I’ve been working on a podcast about the sphere your family found in 1974…” </p>
<p>I start with: I know your family has chosen not to discuss this.</p>
<p>“It’s been difficult to figure out what to write to you because I don’t know the best way to show you my intentions are not to sensationalize, nor to exploit. Through my research I’ve interviewed two of Dr. Hynek’s sons about this sphere they had in their house growing up.”  </p>
<p>I try to show her this is really well-researched.</p>
<p>“But I don’t only care about the ball. For me, that’s a small piece of this story. From the very beginning I’ve admired you and thought you were incredible. I want listeners to understand that too. You know, there’s an entire ‘Gerri Betz’ folder of articles in The Florida Times-Union library. The focus of the folder isn’t the ball, it’s your work in the community: pre-sphere discovery. Stories about you standing up to City Council…” </p>
<p>You know all this already.</p>
<p>“I’m 100 percent willing to work with you. If you even agree to talk, but don't want to talk about the ball, that’s OK. I won’t cross any lines. I just think it’s extremely important for me to actually speak to you. If anything, would you be open to fact-checking some of what I’ve uncovered?” </p>
<p> I left her my cell number and email. </p>
<p>“I really hope to hear from you. Lindsey.”</p>
<p>I send it to an address she’s associated with, hoping she’ll receive it. </p>
[Music]
<p>In trying to make sense of all these rabbit holes I reached out to a couple guys who also recently did a deep dive into the “Betz Mystery Sphere,”  Scott Philbrook</p>
<p><strong>[Scott Philbrook:]</strong><br /> “OK, Lindsey, I’m starting our record session here.” </p>
<p>And Forrest Burgess </p>
<p><strong>[Forrest Burgess:]</strong><br /> “I have our show script notes punched up in case there’s a question I have to search for.” </p>
<p>They host the podcast Astonishing Legends. I thought it would be helpful to sort of compare notes and talk through some of what I’m stuck on. </p>
<p>On their podcast, they basically look into stuff they’re interested in: The paranormal, weird science, odd historical stories. </p>
<p><strong>[Hosts:]</strong><br /> “I guess we consider everything every possibility going in, but try not to settle on one before going in and discounting the others would you see, a lot of times, especially with people who study this kind of thing…” “Yeah, we don't rule it out. But conversely, with people who are open to wilder explanations, we also don't rule out mundane explanations. And sometimes we do an investigation and at the end of it, it seems like maybe it was much more mundane than the legends and the lore around it would have you believe. Other times, we do an investigation, and at the end of it, it seems like it’s the craziest thing you’ve ever heard in your life.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Like the Betz sphere. They have this interview with an anonymous woman who they say is a member of the Betz family, although not Gerri. And the source even says she was there when her family member found the ball. </p>
<p><strong>[Hosts:]</strong><br />“Having a first-hand account, that's something a lot of times we don't get a chance at getting, because we're often talking about things that are hundreds of years old, and everybody's dead. So it’s nice to talk to somebody who was there.”</p>
<p>She backs up a lot of what we’ve heard before, plus that the Betz family knows where the ball is, but, no one in the family has it at their house because they’ve entrusted a third party with it for safekeeping. </p>
<p>She tells the story of Terry, the guy who found the ball, being flown home and separated from the ball. She says the ball actually rolled up hill in front of a crowd and all the footage was confiscated.</p>
<p>She even says Dr. Hynek told the family, if the ball was flown it would have to be kept in a special cage so it wouldn’t interfere with the plane. Nan told me this too. </p>
<p>She talked about those dead trees in the area where the ball was found, saying the tops were twisted and broken, but most likely from a storm. She says people who worked at the paper mill, told her family they’d never seen balls like the Betzes’.</p>
<p>But there are a few things she says that are different: That the ball stopped rolling around and acting weird after it came back from the UFO conference, which would have been before Hynek allegedly came to the Betz house to examine the ball. When he came to the house, she says Gerri didn’t give him permission to take the ball in his room, but rather she got up and caught him with it, doing tests.</p>
<p>This person says the outside of the ball had very specific markings and those are this still on it, so this ball they have may not have been switched, but instead tampered with or cut open. And again, the new x-rays didn’t match.  Gerri thought Hynek had something to do with all that. Although I have him on tape saying the ball was pretty ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong> [On old radio show]“It seems like a perfectly normal metal sphere.”</p>
<p>This source says after he spent time with the ball he told the family it was amazing and did think it may have been extraterrestrial. She said he took shavings from the ball, and the atomic number didn’t make sense. She said he had his sights set on the ball.</p>
<p>I ran this by Jerry Clark- the UFO expert who said, Hynek just wasn’t that strategic. And Hynek’s son Paul.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Your dad never publicly said it was, you know, extraterrestrial. I think he was quoted, and I think this was when he was part of the blue ribbon panel, that none will go so far as to say it's extraterrestrial, they would be putting their scientific reputations on the line. However, the family, who found the ball, said to them, you know, in private, he very much did believe it was something more than that. Do you know if...does that sound like him? Is that possible?”</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />“It's certainly possible. I think what I heard my father say was always, you know, it's hard for someone to speak in definite terms. ‘This is extraterrestrial,’ for example. I think you'd be more inclined to say, ‘This is quite mysterious,’ or ‘I have, I've had a metallurgical analysis done of this, and we can't place it's origin,’ things like that. So I don't know what he said, but I can imagine that he would be a little bit looser in his verbiage with the people that are reported it then in public. Sure.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />This anonymous family member said the family knew scientists Hynek and Harder very well, formed friendships with them.</p>
<p>She says maybe the ball was something dangerous from the military that was deactivated…but the family just wanted to know what it was, and still does.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Did you try to get your hands on the sphere? And did you find it weird, if you did, that you weren't able to? Or that they don't really want to tell anyone where it is? I mean, that would kind of solve it, right? If we could get it and then, have someone examine it today?”</p>
<p><strong>[Astonishing Legends hosts:]</strong><br />“Yeah, it may not be, as we said earlier, the same sphere. So it doesn't, I don't know that it would solve any mysteries because, and I don't think they necessarily are either at this point, because it could have been swapped in New Orleans. It could have even been swapped in the initial x-ray when it went to the Navy, although the family members were relatively convinced that if it was nearly identical, it had all the same abrasions.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />The source said, things just got really crazy. With people showing up and wanting to buy the ball. Nan had told me people were camping on the Betz’ property. This source said Gerri found out her phones had been tapped. </p>
<p>So is figuring out what the ball is now, really worth it?</p>
<p>The <em>Astonishing Legends</em> hosts both said they don’t know what the ball is although they have theories. Like maybe it was in development for some sort of military use and the project was never fully realized. Or maybe it was intended as part of a larger machine. Like why would its only function to be rolling around weirdly? Maybe it had a purpose when attached to other machinery? You just can’t say for sure because we don’t have enough information about what was inside it. But they don’t believe it was from the paper mill. </p>
<p>I don’t know if I can accept that theory either. It’s still so weird to me that the ball was never, or least not publicly) side-by-side compared to a ball from the paper mill or with the sculptor’s metal spheres. So I can’t jump to those conclusions and as a reporter, I don’t want to just speculate. So what do I do with this?</p>
<p><strong>[Scott Philbrook:]</strong><br />“Everybody wants to be able to wrap up in a package, this assessment of the players and what they're saying and how it relates to the story. And you just don't always get to do that. Because it's sometimes it's just so complicated and so great. And there's so many overlapping gray areas, that all you can do is just look at all the information. And then, as Forrest likes to say sometimes, live with the question.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />They brought something up that I think is really the key in all this. Do you believe the ball acted as the family says it does? Having some sense of self-awareness. Knowing where the edge of the table was? Because if you do, how could it be some ball from the paper mill? Forrest and Scott really believe the family.</p>
<p>I think It’s sort of like when someone says they’ve seen a ghost. If the person is on TV, it’s easy to say, yeah, sure you did. But when it’s your dad or best friend confiding in you, why would they make that up? That’s the vibe I get from those who know Gerri. Yeah, the story is weird, but it happened, because Gerri said it did and she’s not a liar.</p>
<p>Throughout this whole process, I’ve reached out to Gerri and a few other family members multiple times and have mostly been met with silence, and I’ve lost a lot of sleep…</p>
<p>But while I’m at work one day I realize I have a missed call and voicemail.</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:] </strong><br />“Hello, Lindsey. This is Gerri Betz Jackson. I got your letter and I’m calling you back. I’m in the middle of...”</p>
<p>She tells me she’s dealing with something important, but I’m not going to give away anything personal.</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:] </strong><br />“But some time when I get a chance, it might be next year, I’ll get back with you. Thank you thinking about me. God Bless you, bye bye.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I played it for my editor, Jessica. </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“Oh, wow.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Yeah, so that’s…” </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“So that’s good and bad.”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“I mean, I’m happy to hear from her and that she doesn’t sound mad at me.” </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“No, she sounded very lovely.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“But I’m disappointed, obviously, because this is launching before next year.” </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“Right.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“But yeah, so, I called her back, and then she just said, call me next year and we’ll talk about it.” </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“Ugh. Well, that just makes you want to say we’ll have a special episode coming next year, right?” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“I mean, she’s so sweet that I don’t know if she just won’t say no, and she’s not going to do it. I mean, that’s my gut.” </p>
<p><strong>[Jessica Palombo:]</strong><br />“You don’t know for sure.” </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />“Yeah.” </p>
<p>So this is the end of <em>Odd Ball</em>... for now. When Gerri feels ready to talk, you can be sure a new episode will show up in your feed. For now, I’m living with the question. </p>

<p>From WJCT public media in Jacksonville, this is Episode 4 of Odd Ball. I’m Lindsey Kilbride.</p>
<p><strong>[clips from previous episodes]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Ron Kivett:]</strong><br />"The ball rolled from the center of the table, all the way to the edge and stopped."</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:]</strong><br /> About the best description is that it’s a giant gyroscope.</p>
<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]</strong><br />After a while people will say you’re crazy or this or that, which she is not.</p>
<p><strong>[Nyah:]</strong><br />"This definitely seems like the kind of place that could trigger supernatural thoughts."</p>
<p><strong>[Skeptoid podcast:]</strong><br />that’s a common industrial steel and it’s probably not likely to be something that aliens would use</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />Hynek reached out. He wanted them to come to Chicago and because they were unable to fly with the sphere, she said "no, if you want to see this sphere, you're gonna have to come to us."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I’ve mentioned quite a few times now, the Navy investigated the ball and tried to figure out what it was. Gerri Betz allowed them to take the ball under the condition it’s to be returned in no later than two weeks if it’s not government property. A Navy spokesman initially told reporters, there’s certainly something weird about the ball, but when he ended up returning it to the Betz family, seemed pretty uninterested. He said it was made out of stainless steel and from Earth, although the Navy couldn’t figure out exactly where it came from or what it would have been used for. They wanted to cut the ball open, but Gerri said no.</p>
<p>There’s also Gerri’s claim the Navy tried to take the ball back when returning it to the Betzes’ home...which doesn't really line up with the officer’s nonchalant attitude about the ball to reporters.</p>
<p>But this probe, although the most official — being the government — wasn’t even close to the end of inquiry into the sphere’s origin. So what did others find? And is it possible the Navy was wrong or not truthful?</p>
<p>Early on, Gerri told reporters a UFO research group came to Florida to examine the ball.</p>
<p><strong>[News reporter:]</strong><br />"Who have you talked to so far?"</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri:]</strong><br />"Well we talked to a group of people called NICAP. ‘NYE-cap’ I think is the way they pronounce the name of the organization."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Gerri is talking about NICAP, an acronym for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Jerry Clark, that UFO expert who wrote the encyclopedia,</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />"Which is kind of considered the definitive reference work on this subject."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He wrote quite a bit about NICAP, a citizen-led UFO research group, whose members ranged from scientists to clergymen. It was founded in the mid-50s, and Clark described the group as a sober and responsible forum for UFO investigation. In other words, members distanced themselves from the more fringe UFO claims like abduction.</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:] </strong><strong>[from an archive tape]</strong><br />"They came out and examined the ball and they said it was very precision made. It has a magnetic pole on it. One side repels, and the other side attracts. It has a hollow core."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />This is kind of hard to understand, but luckily NICAP published its findings in the May ‘74 edition of its monthly newsletter, The UFO Investigator, headlined "Mysterious Steel Sphere Explained."</p>
<p>Many details in this report aren’t new to me because they’d already been reported in newspapers, so very quickly:</p>
<p>The ball was x-rayed at the Cecil Field Navy Station, but the machine used wasn’t powerful enough to penetrate the sphere so it was then taken to another station in Jacksonville for the more powerful x-ray, which was successful.</p>
<p>The sphere was beat up, like it had been rolled on concrete and had a small triangular chip out of the side. The ball was magnetic and perfectly balanced.</p>
<p>The investigation was led by a mechanical engineer, and he ended up agreeing with the popular theory it was probably part of a valve used in machines at the paper plant. The plant’s spokesman had said balls just like the Betzses’ had been discarded by the plant 15 years before, and they could have ended up anywhere, including on the Betzes’ property I guess.</p>
<p>The report concluded the ball’s odd rolling was due to uneven floors at the Betz house, attributing that theory to the Navy’s spokesman.</p>
<p>A lot of the NICAP report credits the Navy’s findings, but with much more detail than what I’ve seen in the news reports. The actual Navy report is nowhere to be found. I submitted numerous public records requests to government agencies and archival departments and they were all unable to find anything. So right now this is the best I’ve got.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s new to me:</p>
<p>In addition to an x-ray taken by a more powerful machine, an emission spectrographic analysis identified the material of the sphere to be stainless steel 431. So now we know the methods they used, but not a lot about how they work.</p>
<p>Luckily Florida State University geochemistry Professor Munir Humayun does.</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br />"My expertise is in the study of extraterrestrial materials, particularly in metals from extraterrestrial materials and our analysis."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>He told me this type of analysis is a way of determining the chemical composition of an object. So for this ball it would have analyzed the exterior and revealed OK, this is stainless steel. I also wanted to know more about these magnetic poles, referenced in articles, which either describe the ball as have 3 or 4 of them.</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong>"It means it's seen a couple of different magnetic fields. It’s been exposed to some magnetic fields, and it's picked up that magnetism. Some of it would have picked up when you melted the sphere and formed it because it would form in the Earth's magnetic field. And so it will carry a little bit of a memory of the Earth's magnetic field. But if it's exposed to anything, this is a real problem for us, when we study magnetic fields and, say, iron meteorites. People who want to check whether they're truly iron attach a magnet to them. And every time somebody puts a magnet on a piece of metal, it acquires a little bit of that magnetic field...it's very weak."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"And so is it odd that the sphere would have these magnetic poles?"</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong><br />"I bet somebody walked up to it and stuck a magnet on it."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />So in other words, multiple magnetic fields means it could have just been touched by magnets.</p>
<p>The report goes on to say the x-ray determined the sphere to be uniformly hollow with three little balls inside. One, an eighth of an inch, and two of them even tinier. Spherical specks really. There was also a small amount of powdered residue inside — possibly sand, the scientist speculates.</p>
<p>Then the Navy took an ultrasonic measurement which Humayun says bounces high-frequency waves into the ball. That would tell scientists the thickness of the ball’s shell — about a half-inch — and the report gives more exact measurements of the ball. The diameter: 7.9 inches, and weight: 21.3 lbs.</p>
<p>It says the ball also had a plug welded into the side a fourth of an inch wide, ground off and polished.</p>
<p>But I have to say some parts of this report just make me question how well the writer or investigator knew the story. On one hand Gerri does characterize NICAP’s work as "an investigation." But the way this report is written, it makes me wonder, did they even touch the ball or just cite the Navy? All the conclusions are based on the Navy’s findings. The first paragraph says the ball was found in the Betzes’ backyard, but it was actually found on property miles from the home. It also spelled Gerri’s name wrong. A lot of articles have these errors, but this person supposedly did an investigation. Seems kind of odd to me.</p>
<p>Then there’s this so-called researcher Carl Williston or Wilson? I’m not sure because it’s spelled differently in various articles, and I can find absolutely no record of him or this Omega Minus One research firm he supposedly worked for. I even ran his name and firm by Jerry Clark.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Do you know someone by the name of Carl Wilson or Williston from the Omega Minus One Institute out of Baton Rouge? Does that ring a bell of something that existed?"</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />"No."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And he knows a lot of people in the UFO research community. I’m going to go out on a limb and say most. But in early news stories Gerri Betz says this guy Carl came to Florida and examined the ball for six hours.</p>
<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]</strong><br />"I found radio waves coming from it and a magnetic field around it."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Some of the scientists are dead now, so we’re gonna hear them played by actors.</p>
<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]</strong><br />"I was unable to determine a pattern in the sphere’s movement."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />There’s also this 2012 blog write-up online which says Willson suggested:</p>
<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]</strong><br />"The metal that made up the shell of the orb contained an unknown element making it slightly different than stainless steel."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But I could not find the source of that anywhere. I also messaged the writer on Twitter. Did not hear back. So, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>[Carl Williston reenactor:]</strong><br />"Yes."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Sorry, but I have to take your findings with a grain of salt because I don’t know if you’re real. So I’m going to set this one aside for now.</p>
<p>I don’t doubt someone by this name researched the ball, but I can’t really vet this claim if I don't know who made it.</p>
<p>Around this time — remember, all these investigations happen within days or a week of each other in April of 1974 — the ball was taken to New Orleans where the National Enquirer’s five-member blue ribbon UFO panel of scientists investigated the sphere: an astronomer, a civil engineer, philosophy professor, a plant physiologist and psychologist, Leo Sprinkle… Who...remembers nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />"It's a beautiful case, I'm sorry that I can't contribute anything to it."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And unfortunately there are very few Betz sphere-related articles published after the panel looked at it. Like, no one big report outlining the panel’s findings or what members did to the ball. The best I’ve got in an Associated Press article published one day after the panel. "Five scientists intently watched a mysterious sphere for several hours Saturday, but it refused to perform." One scientist, James Harder, said they hadn’t been able to establish any unusual movements, and he’d like to cut it open. His colleague Robert Creegan said it may have come from Cape Canaveral. ‘I’m not sure what to make out of this, other than it doesn’t seem like the ball was remarkable.’ But, another colleague, J. Allen Hynek, the astronomer, and eventually —</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />"The most famous UFO proponent in the world"</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />The same guy who allegedly slept with the ball in his room, he appeared on a Seattle radio show a day after returning from the New Orleans conference, this is before he allegedly visited the ball at the Betz home. And I have the tape.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio show sound:]</strong><br /><strong>[Host:]</strong><br />"Professor Hynek returned yesterday from New Orleans after sharing observations with colleagues regarding the so-called ‘mystery sphere.’ That sphere discovered a few weeks past by Terry Matthews, near Jacksonville, Florida. Let me ask you, first, Professor Hynek, about your latest evaluations of the sphere. Do you consider this now extraterrestrial or Earth manufactured?</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />No, there's no evidence whatsoever that either I or the other members of the UFO panel can find that would indicate that it is extraterrestrial. That doesn't, of course, absolutely prove it isn't, but there is no obvious evidence. For instance, if it had come in from outer space, it undoubtedly would have had some sort of that ablation or burn marks on it, and it seems like a perfectly normal metal sphere."</p>
<p><strong>[Host:]</strong><br />"I see. If that is true, then why hasn't someone stepped forward to, to make claim?"</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />Well, I wonder that very same thing.</p>
<p><strong>[Host:]</strong><br />Do you have any theories about that?</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />Well, no, I'm very much wondering why it seems to me that if it were perfectly normal and natural, that somebody surely would have said, ‘Well, I've got one like that in my garage,’ or, ‘Our company makes two of those a week’ or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>We, of course, know now, those exact things did happen. A woman said she had a ball like the Betzes’ in her garage, and the paper plant said the ball was likely part of one of its machines.</p>
<p><strong>[Seattle radio host:]</strong><br />"Professor Hynek, when I left the story on Saturday, I was told that the sphere was considered solid. However, three balls on the inside, I believe they were called balls, were believed to be there and that they were embedded in the material. Ahat's the latest on that?"</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br /> "Well, the thing is definitely not hollow, at least not largely hollow. There might be some spaces in it because when you shake it, something inside definitely rattled, but the x-ray shows, indicates that there's no sharp line of demarcation between the shell and anything on the inside…"</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Some of that tape is breaking up. But I need to stop here because Hynek is saying, while the ball isn’t solid stainless steel — that would make it way too heavy and dense — he doesn’t think it’s largely hollow. In an article that day, he said the x-ray shows the little pellets inside are possibly suspended in a liquid. But the Navy said it was hollow, aside from the tiny balls inside…And remember Hynek is a real scientist. At this point he’s directing Northwestern University’s Astronomical research center and chairing the astronomy department. So can this really be up for debate, whether the ball is or isn’t hollow? Could the Navy be wrong?</p>
<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong><br />"I think based on this image, you really can’t tell."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Dr. Diane Johnson is a diagnostic radiologist at Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville and she spends a lot of time looking at scans, mostly of humans.</p>
<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong><br />"Mammograms, CT scans, ultrasound, plain x rays, and MRI exams."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Hynek’s logic behind questioning whether the Betz sphere is largely hollow, is the way the x-ray looks. So I sent Dr. Johnson a copy. Now, this copy has been published by the Ancient Aliens TV show and the Astonishing Legends podcast. It looks like this: a light grey circle with hazy edges, and the three little balls inside are much darker than their surroundings. Two look like perfect spheres, and one the other looks like it’s been squashed almost. Hynek says since there’s not a clear distinction between the shell and whatever is inside, there must be something in there other than air.</p>
<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong><br />"t's probably a photograph of a copy of an x-ray is my best guess. My first impression is that it clearly looks old, so old, and in such that it's an old picture, but also old in that it looks like it's old technology to obtain that image.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>And she said, it’s true, from this picture alone, you can’t tell if the ball is hollow.</p>
<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong><br />"It's a sphere, so you're taking a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional structure. And that's going to make it a little bit difficult to see the- the outer shell interface with the inner substance, presumably air if it's hollow. And the other factor is the resolution of the image itself. It's just not good enough to be able to see that interface. And if the shell around the outside is very thin, you wouldn't necessarily see it anyway. Basically, with x-rays, we're looking at differences in density. And that’s what allows us to see images. So if you think about the chest x-ray that you always see on medical shows, you see the heart, you see the bones, and you see fat, and air. And so all of those things are different densities on x-ray. And that’s why you can see those different images. If you put a completely fat density object next to another completely fat density object, you wouldn't see anything on the x-ray. You have to have objects next to each other that have differences in density."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>But her best guess?</p>
<p><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong>"It’s very likely hollow. That would be my opinion."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Because ultrasonic measurements did establish a wall thickness, and when you shake it, you can hear the balls rattling around. As a confusing little twist: Although Hynek said the sphere wasn’t largely hollow, in a later article Hynek does refer to the ball as being hollow, along with one of his colleagues on the UFO panel.</p>
<p>I asked FSU Professor Humayun the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong>We don't know what else is inside of it. It could be air, but it could be something else, or probably not. Yeah, it could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Except something like liquid mercury, which would show up on the x-ray. Of course, scientists in 1974 probably had the actual x-rays, not a washed-out photocopy. But we don’t know for sure what’s in the ball. And I want to point in later articles, Hynek changes his opinion and says the ball IS hollow.</p>
<p>This makes figuring out what the ball is so tough. Based on the little science we have, we know so little. We don’t know what’s in it. We have conflicting reports about if it even did, in fact, move oddly. And we have all these theories: it’s part of a valve, it was going to be part of a sculpture. But the Betz ball was never (at least not publicly) side-by-side compared and contrasted with the any of the items.</p>
<p>Back to Hynek.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong><br />"Professor Hynek, given that it’s man-made, how do we account here for the orbiting of the sphere?</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />Well, I think we have concluded that’s largely of a little bit of wishful thinking. Certainly did not behave that way when my colleagues and I examined it. In fact, I had to keep it from rolling off the table several times."</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong><br />"I don't understand. In other words, it did move but it did not orbit? Did it move of its own accord?"</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />"No, no. It only moved when you moved it yourself. And, of course, one thing it does, is it is fairly heavy as it moves along, it unbalances the table. It presses down a little bit. And if might seem, if a table weren't completely level, it might seem to be moving by itself. But that is not the part that intrigues me.</p>
<p><strong>[Host:]</strong><br />"Would you tell me what part does?"</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />"The fact that several witnesses had said that when the dog was brought near it to be photographed along with, the dog rolled over and put its paws over its ears, as though it heard sounds coming out not audible to our ears but audible to a dog's ears."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>So Hynek doesn’t seem too impressed with the ball and believes it’s from Earth. But he is interested in the claim that the Betzes’ toy poodle would whimper and cover her ears around the sphere. That’s also what the FSU geochemistry professor told me he was most interested in. Hynek goes on to say the ball should be coming to Northwestern, where he works, in about a week. And he had several tests planned.</p>
<p>But the ball never made it up there. The Betz family says Hynek instead came to their house.</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br />"He wanted them to come to Chicago. He said, ‘No, if you want to see this sphere, you're gonna have to come to us.’ So he came."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Reminder, that’s Nan, the magazine editor who recently had a phone call with Gerri. But this is confusing for me because Hynek doesn’t seem to back that up publicly, or at least he didn’t seven months later when interviewed in an Indiana newspaper.</p>
<p>In this story, Gerri Betz is quoted saying the tests run thus far indicate the ball is probably man-made — so she agrees with the Navy on that — but she still wants to know what it is.</p>
<p>Her son Terry, who found the ball, is quoted saying the state of Florida is trying to claim it. First time I’ve heard this, but I think I’m now totally desensitized to a lot of the more outrageous allegations.</p>
<p>Then there’s Hynek’s interview. He said he examined the thing just one time at the New Orleans UFO conference. We just heard his interview about that. Afterward, the family didn’t send the ball to him so he lost all interest in it. He actually seems kind of annoyed in the article.</p>
<p>He said he wasn’t able to spend enough time examining it at the conference but doubled-down: The ball is man-made. He added he would examine the ball if it was sent to him.</p>
<p>The story says the ball hadn’t been cut open because the Betzes want Hynek to examine it first. And I really love this part of the article: Hynek is quoted saying he wants to be there when it happens, when the ball is cut open, saying it could go like this: <strong>[dream music]</strong></p>
<p>"Doctor, hand me the cutting torch. Stand back, everybody, because I don’t really know what will happen."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>The ball is open. A little orange man about 6 inches tall steps out, looks around and says, "Goorfie, snall gank splort popsem! Translation: "Smile, you’re on candid camera."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>I’m not kidding. This imaginary scene Hynek dreamt up is printed in the newspaper article.</p>
<p>But while Hynek was joking about an extraterrestrial explanation, another scientist wasn’t...after the break.</p>

Or, come poke around WJCT.org. OK, now let’s get back to Odd Ball.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>If you’ve been listening to this and at any point Googled "Betz sphere," you’ve probably read about the ball’s amazing properties. Most of them come from James Harder, a civil and hydraulic engineer from Berkeley. He was also a member of the National Enquirer’s blue ribbon UFO panel, along with Hynek and Sprinkle, which investigated the ball.</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]</strong><br />"The ball seems to have some remarkable properties."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Again, this is an actor saying Harder’s paraphrased and actual quotes about the ball.</p>
<p>More than a year and a half after the panel he was a part of examined the Betz ball, Harder was quoted in an article headlined "Experts Disagree on Florida Sphere Origin."</p>
<p>While Hynek said publicly the ball wasn’t remarkable, his colleague Harder said:</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]</strong><br />"I found the thing to be in perfect balance in a way I would not have expected it to be. The results of the x-rays taken on the thing were not what you’d expect them to be."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Will you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder:]</strong><br />"No, no."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Huh, OK.</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]</strong><br />"I don’t see how Dr. Hynek could be sure whether it is man-made or not without running further tests. There hasn't been enough research done on the thing to declare it to be man-made or otherwise. And I can’t understand why Dr. Hynek’s so interested in the thing if he thinks it isn’t UFO-related." Mrs. Betz told me that Dr. Hynek noticed the dead trees around the area where the sphere was found but i think it would be interesting to discover if he is about about admit to those trees."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>OK, so Harder is saying there were dead trees in the area where the ball was found, which was not in any other articles I read about the sphere and Gerri did not mention that in her interview with Ron the radio host.</p>
<p>But Hynek addressed this in the article, saying he did see the dead trees (so I’m going to go with it’s true) but he doesn't think it’s possible to relate dead trees to the finding of the ball.</p>
<p>This article was published a year and half after Harder studied it along with Hynek and other colleagues in New Orleans, And now Gerri Betz is saying she wants Harder to examine it again, because he has more experience in the field of engineering than Hynek and she wants to make an agreement to have a member of her family present at the research sessions.</p>
<p>It seems like she now doesn’t trust anyone else to be alone with it.</p>
<p>But here’s where things get weirder. Harder’s alleged comments get printed in this giant book I ordered, the Encyclopedia of UFOs — different than Clark’s multi-volume UFO Encyclopedia). This book is by a guy named Ronald Story, and there’s a section on the Betz sphere and even a photo of Terry, Gerri’s son who found the sphere, holding the ball with a National Enquirer Blue Ribbon Panel banner behind him. He’s 21, a kid with a plaid shirt, wavy long hair, big wire-frame glasses and a mustache. Basically a hipster today.</p>
<p>The book, published in 1980, says Harder found the ball exhibits four magnetic poles, which lines up with most news reports, that the ball either had three or four of them. And that’s not that weird according to FSU Professor Humayun.</p>
<p>But the book says Harder claims the x-ray shows those little balls inside the sphere are more dense than the shell. So in other words not just pieces of the shell that fell inside during manufacturing, something else, a different material.</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]</strong><br />"Thus a substantial portion of the weight is in the internal material and the shell could be much thinner than a half-inch."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Can the shell’s thickness be debatable? According to the NICAP report, which looks like it mostly just copies the Navy’s report, ultrasonic measurements established the wall thickness to be a half-inch with a tiny margin of error, within a hundredth of an inch. But, if that were true, the ball would actually be about 3 lbs heavier.</p>
<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]</strong><br />"It really depends on, how valid are all these measurements?"</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>That’s a mechanical engineer who I happen to know really well. He’s my brother Sean. I called him to ask, how big of a deal is this shell thickness discrepancy?</p>
<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]</strong><br />"We’re saying it’s exactly a half an inch, but we don’t know if anyone is rounding there. The thickness is really important because whenever you’re doing a volume calculation, the formula for volume is the radius to the third power. If they’re rounding anywhere there, that error get propagated throughout that equation, and it could be off by a larger amount. So if anyone is off by any of their measurements, then that could totally mess up our estimation."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Also, the report said an emission spectrographic analysis was used to determine the outside of the ball was stainless steel.</p>
<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]</strong>"The other thing we don’t know is how close the steel is to the specifications. So basically if that steel is exactly grade 431 steel, we know what the density should be, but if the mixture is off a little bit or if there’s anything that’s been done to it to change the chemical composition, then it might not be the same as the density that’s published. We don’t know how close it is to your ideal steel of that type."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Remember, this report is from a nonprofit UFO research group. It happens to cite more details from the Navy than I’d seen anywhere else. But it’s not the official Navy report and we don’t have the details from that metal analysis, so we can’t say this is 100% accurate.</p>
<p><strong>[Sean Kilbride:]</strong>Whenever you do the calculation, it’s about 15 percent off from what it should be. We don’t know exactly how accurate those measurements are, so it’s not something I’d be super concerned with."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>So maybe Harder has something, or maybe there was just some rounding in the report, but Harder is also quoted saying the little balls inside the sphere are more dense than the shell. They do look much darker than the rest of the ball. Does the x-ray actually prove that? Radiologist Diane Johnson again:</p>
<p><strong><strong>[Diane Johnson:]</strong><br /></strong>"It's difficult because it's a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional structure. But it does look like those are separate and potentially higher in density. Although you can't really say that for sure because they could be thicker, made of the same material. You know, for example, they could be a solid stainless steel little metal ball versus a stainless steel shell. It's hard to say just based on that one image."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>I asked FSU professor Humayun the same question:</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>"Would it be wrong for people to assume that just in making the sphere that little pieces of the shell just, you know, while making it they just kind of fell down?"</p>
<p><strong>[Munir Humayun:]</strong>"Yeah, those don't look like, they look like little spheres. They look quite deliberate within there. They don't look like broken fragments of the shell."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Wow, so this makes me entertain Harder’s comments much more than I had previously.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say the ball is hollow and the shell is stainless steel 431, but the inside, it’s kind of a mystery.</p>
<p>However, that’s not all this book said Harder found. It says he spoke before the International UFO Congress in 1977 (Basically a convention for UFO people). That’s about three years after the sphere was found. ‘Dr Harder presented his truly astounding recent findings on the sphere.’ (So this is essentially confirming he did reexamine the ball, like he said he wanted to in the article a year and a half before.) He asserted, based on his x-rays, that the two internal spheres</p>
<p><strong>[James Harder reenactor:]</strong><br />"Are made of elements far heavier than anything known to science. The Betz sphere contains elements having atomic numbers higher than 140. The heaviest element yet produced in any atomic reactor here on Earth has an atomic number of 105. If one were to drill into the sphere perhaps one of the masses would go critical and explode like an atomic bomb."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>While Hynek says the ball is nothing special, Harder is apparently here saying this is like nothing we’ve seen on Earth. So while I think Hynek could be onto something with the densities, I don’t know how seriously to take this book. Here’s why: This book seems to be the source for these claims, like I can’t find another article or book where he’s making such extreme declarations. Every modern write-up about the ball quotes this book. So I did a little more digging and actually found a book titled Proceedings of the First International UFO Congress 1977, same year. Harder is in this book a lot. He gave a talk on the hard evidence for UFOs, no mention of the Betz ball. He’s part of a panel discussion along with Leo Sprinkle, who you heard earlier, and Hynek, about if people who have more than one UFO experience should be taken seriously. But there’s no mention of this speech about the sphere that the UFO encyclopedia excerpt says he gave at the conference. Granted, this book is just the best-of lectures. One of the editors of the book was Jerry Clark, the UFO expert. He attended the conference.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />I have no memory of hearing anything like that. You know I was involved in the organization of it. When that conference was going on, I was running around a lot, but I did participate in some of the sub-conferences where people who were speaking there got together and batted around ideas and.. now, it's possible, you know, that that he said something, but I just, you know, I just don't remember. This whole episode came and went without making much of an impression on anybody because I don't see it in the literature.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>There’s no mention of the Betz sphere in his giant encyclopedia.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />"And I spent an enormous amount of time reading UFO literature, including official documents and old UFO publications from the 50s and 60s, and as many books as I could get my hands on. Now, if it had really been with Harder says it was, it certainly would have made an impression, and it would be something like proof of some kind of, you know, otherworldly visitations. That clearly wasn't that, whatever it was."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>"I kind of just want to get a feel for, you know, who Harder was and sort of how different he was from Hynek."</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />"You know, there's a certain kind of person you run into if you're around this field and you meet people. You know, people who have impressive professional educational credentials. You're glad that they decided to look into this question because we certainly need that kind of expertise. We’re trying to understand what's going on. But sometimes, you find that people who in their ordinary lives are capable scientists and professionals, kind of throw that all out the window when they look at UFOs. This is like they have some kind of metaphysical itch they want to scratch with UFOs and then they just get in and they’re just other crazy people. And there's no shortage of them as it is. And that was my — don't quote me because this is just based upon things that picked up over the years — but I was never impressed with Harder."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>So Clark thought Harder wasn’t skeptical enough, but also admits he didn’t know him personally.</p>
<p>Leo Sprinkle, the member of the blue ribbon panel we talked to earlier, he knew Harder a bit better.</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />Dr. Jim Harder, he was interested in the physical evidence. Some cases that had even photographs of flying saucers or whatever it is."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>Sprinkle himself studied more of the fringe UFO claims, the stuff organizations like NICAP distanced themselves from, including people who claimed to have had contact with extraterrestrials. Remember he is a psychologist and really interested in people.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>"How did you perceive Harder as a scientist looking into these claims?"</p>
<p><strong>[Sprinkle:]</strong><br />You know, I perceived him as very bright, very capable, emphasizing the physical science aspect, more than that social science aspect. Whereas I think Hynek was very interested in both. But I appreciate Jim Harder’s approach because he was careful in trying to determine what is called normal, physically tired, what is unusual, physical aspects of flying saucers and people.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>So, two totally different opinions.</p>
<p>Now I want to play a part of Hynek’s radio interview that stuck out to me. The host asks him about the death of a man who used to write about UFOs, and he immediately seems to shoot down a rumor.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong></p>
<p>"I want to ask you, what do you think of is it Frank Edwards? Does he hold weight, in your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />He's been deceased.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong>I understand that, under mysterious circumstances,</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />No, heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>[Radio host:]</strong>Oh, someone told me otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />No, I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>To me, Hynek sounds like someone who doesn't buy into conspiracies, even as someone who spent his later life looking into UFOs.</p>
<p>But something else stood out to me when I was researching all this. I mentioned to Leo Sprinkle, Hynek’s former colleague on the National Enquirer panel, that Hynek said this about the ball’s odd movements:</p>
<p><strong>[J. Allen Hynek:]</strong><br />"Well, I think we have concluded it largely is a little bit of wishful thinking."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong>And that's totally opposite of what the family says happened at the conference. So I'm just sort of trying to sort through those two sides.</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong>"Strange because I usually perceived Allen Hynek as being not only sympathetic but willing to discuss with the witness or the families what they're experiencing. And that makes it sound like he was covering...like there was something he didn't want to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>[music]</strong></p>
<p>I found Sprinkle’s comment about Hynek really eerie…I think something happened either with Harder or Hynek...Maybe it was that Harder believed the ball was something more remarkable than what everyone else had told Gerri Betz and she started believing it too, but maybe it was something else. Here’s my case.</p>
<p>Gerri is quoted about half a year after her son found the sphere, saying tests show it’s most likely man-made, but that she still wants to know what it is...But then there’s the later article in which Harder is arguing there’s no proof it’s man-made… and Gerri is quoted saying this: "I believe there’s evidence we have something from a UFO on our hands. There are circumstances surrounding the object that made me feel it has some properties that our scientists aren’t familiar with." She was of the opinion the Navy was hiding something from the public for security reasons. "They know more than they’re saying," she said.</p>
<p>So what happened? In that same later article Gerri says Hynek came to Florida and spent the day with her family the year before, and Hynek pleaded to take it with him but she refused. Hynek doesn’t confirm in the article if he actually did go to the family’s home.</p>
<p>Nan, the magazine editor, had a little more insight. This is what Gerri told her happened around that period of time.</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong>"The sphere was never the same. And Gerri thinks that he swapped it out with a dummy."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"You know, I recently read an article with Hynek's son because he because there's a new TV show called Blue Book based on Hynek's work and these UFO sightings. So Hynek's son is an advisor on the show. At the very last sentence of the article, he said, you know, he was talking about how they had all this stuff in their house, like a library of artifacts or whatever. And he's like, ‘Yeah, we had this metal ball in our house that I found out later on was from some Florida UFO case.’"</p>
<p><strong>[Paul Hynek:]</strong><br />"Are you insinuating, Lindsey, that my father is some kind of UFO kleptomaniac?"</p>

<p>From WJCT Public Media in Jacksonville, this is Episode 3 of <em>Odd Ball</em>. I'm Lindsey Kilbride.</p>
<p><strong>[Montage of clips from previous episodes:]</strong><br /> </p>
<p><strong>[Caren Burmeister:]</strong><br /> "The trucks would break down on the highway and the driver would call her and say, you know, 'Something's wrong with it,' and so she would probe him with questions. She would just have these real strong
  instinct or gut feelings." </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "I quickly realized that if I was going to ask the family anything about the Betz Sphere, I was not going to get anywhere with the family." </p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz:]</strong><br /> "Definitely, it's not a ball valve." </p>
<p><strong>[Speaker 3:]</strong><br /> "She took me around and she showed me some of the places where some of the strange events had occurred."</p>
<p><strong>[Historian Tim Gilmore:]</strong><br /> "The house was built in the late 1920s. Nettleton Neff. He shot himself. And he never lived in the house."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br /> "We found we found the house!" Nyah: "This is definitely the type of area that inspires paranormal thinking."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br /> "So you talked to Gerri on Monday?" </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "I did."</p>
<p><strong>[Theme music fades out]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br /> Years before I started reporting this story and also just within the last few months, other podcasters, YouTubers and bloggers have published their own research and thoughts about Betz Sphere. But one in
  particular, the podcast Astonishing Legends, came out during the peak of my research, which led to sort of a mid-series crisis. </p>
<p><strong>[Talking to intern Al Pete:]</strong><br /> "OK. I think it was Friday. It was put on my radar, that a different podcast, basically did the same story I'm working on. It's a major gut punch. And I know I mentioned it to you earlier in the
  week. But I was definitely considering just dropping it. But I don't know. Do you think that still should be something to consider? Or do you think that we're kind of making enough headway where this is going to be good on its own?"</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br /> "I think we I think we should go ahead and go with it. Yeah, I totally feel like we should go with it. I just feel like the way that is going to be presented is going to be great. Yeah, not even think. I know."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br /> It's weird to listen back to this because I was so close to quitting this project. All I needed was a nudge in that direction. Now, I definitely don't feel that way. But I couldn't ignore this other
  podcast. So I instead called up the hosts, who are super cool and nice. And I talked to them about their findings, which I'll have a little later. But one interesting tidbit I gathered from their research is relevant to what I'm about to get into.
  An anonymous source, who said she's a Betz family member although not Gerri, told those podcast hosts a more exact location of where the ball was found. We really only knew it was found somewhere in the woods on the Betz's acres and acres of
  property. Assuming she's telling the truth, that's helpful information because it pertains to the most prolific theory said to totally debunk the mystery of the ball: that it rolled off the roof of a man's VW bus.</p>
<p><strong>[Old commercial sound:]</strong><br /> "A Volkswagen is a nice station wagon to have around the house. It'll seat your whole family comfortably. Average 23 miles to a gallon a regular and hold on one supply of groceries." Commercial fades
  under narration </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />A guy named James Sterling Jones, who was an artist and hotel manager in Taos, New Mexico, had acquired a bunch of metal balls he was planning to use in a sculpture of a giant clock. One of those balls
  was sitting outside the hotel a couple weeks after the news broke of the Betz discovery. The Coca-Cola man saw it and freaked out because it looked so similar. James Durling-Jones told The Florida Times-Union he was actually driving through
  Jacksonville around Easter of 1971. That's almost exactly three years before the Betz ball was found. The bus was crammed full. So he stuck the spheres up on a luggage carrier on his roof. They lost three or four of them while driving through the
  South. One article is even paired with the cartoon of a man driving a Volkswagen bus, balls flying out of it. And his speech bubble reads "If I can spread a few more of these things around the state, I can make Wells' War of the Worlds look like a
  tea party." </p>
<p>So is this the best explanation? Brian Dunning, co-host the Skeptoid podcast (different than the podcast I just spoke about), thought so when I talked to him a couple years ago. His podcast looks into different theories and legends people
  believe... </p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"&hellip;and where there's more interesting science behind what's actually going on. And that can be anything like a paranormal phenomenon, a, an alternative medicine belief, a conspiracy theory &mdash; the
  whole spectrum of weird things that people believe is just incredibly wealthy."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />In 2012, he released an episode on the Betz sphere.</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"When I heard about this initially, my thought was, 'Oh, well, that sounds like a, like a bladder tank from a spacecraft.' Because occasionally those do fall out of the sky. And people in strange places find
  this weird metal sphere. And they don't know what it is."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He ruled that out because the type of thing he was thinking of would be larger and have attachments for valves.</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"So you know, I had a couple of possible explanations in my mind like that. But then you go and you read about what was reported all of these strange properties that the ball has. And, you know, I've done
  enough stories like this to know that reports are not always accurate that these stories tend to grow over time substantially. And that's exactly what happened in this case, as well."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />His main method of research:</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"Newspaper reports. Largely for doing what I do, when you're trying to go back so far into history, in some cases hundreds of years, contemporary newspaper reports are often one of the best, most reliable
  sources. Because those reports usually came from the day that it happened. There hadn't been any chances yet for anyone to magnify the story."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He thinks that magnification is what's happened with this ball story. Most of the more recent blog posts and YouTube videos focus on the more outrageous claims like that the sphere itself played organ
  music, when, according to Sandy's article, the weird stuff at the house predated the ball. Or that a scientist found the ball was made out of elements heavier than anything known to science, which I found the source on that to be somewhat
  questionable. And we're going to get really deep into the science a little later. But I'm saying this now to point out, I get where Brian is coming from. He points to the Navy's findings that the ball was made out of stainless steel 431.</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"That's a common industrial steel. And it's probably not likely to be something that aliens would use. So we can be pretty sure metallurgically that it's something from some industrial plant right here on
  Earth."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And he wasn't too fixated on the witnesses' claims of the ball's rolling.</p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"Things like this, they're anecdotes, which means evidence that we can't test or verify. It's an Elvis sighting. You know, when you hear of an Elvis sighting, we don't conclude that, 'Oh, someone reported
  seeing Elvis, therefore Elvis is definitely still alive. And this person actually saw him. There's no other possible explanation.' Well, no, it's far more likely that this person was simply mistaken. So this is when you hear an anecdote about the
  ball was rolling around on its own. And people who went there said, oh, their floor was really uneven. Anything you put on it, it's going to roll around." </p>
<p>"There's these places called mystery spots, these little tourist attractions all around the world where balls seem to roll uphill, cars seem to drive up the hill by themselves. Things stick to the wall. And those are simply optical illusions. And
  it's perfectly reasonable. Because the number of people who go through those little tourist attractions and come out convinced that the Betz family could have been equally mistaken about the reason the ball was rolling around, even though the
  floor looks flat to them."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Which brings us back to the theory he settled on: This ball is from artist James Sterling Jones's VW bus. </p>
<p><strong>[Brian Dunning:]</strong><br />"It was an industrial ball check valve that is made of stainless steel 431. Exactly like the Betz mystery sphere. And it is known to have been deposited in the area some years before the best family found
  it. So once we have all the those little strings tied together, I'm satisfied that it's the best explanation anyone's put forward. And like, I think it should be the default theory, the null hypothesis."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />The artist wouldn't confirm the origin of the balls to reporters back in the day because they were maybe, sort of, kind of stolen. He said, 'I can't tell you where I got them because I'd get in trouble.
  But I'll tell you this. They're not from outer space.' </p>
<p>So the balls weren't perfect. Otherwise, they'd be worth several thousand dollars to the company that made them. And if you told reporters the company, they'd want them back. Then he said they weren't stolen but that it would cost his friend his
  job. He did say the spheres were intended as part of an industrial valve like the kind used in high-pressure transmission lines. Some reports say the Betz sphere had this small, smoothed-over plug in its side. And this artist described his spheres
  as having 'welded-over plugs,' which I assume just means patched-up holes. He told a reporter those plugs were an attempt to smooth a surface left flawed by the sphere grinder. </p>
<p>So, I ran this by that higher-up the sphere manufacturing company I spoke with earlier. And he said normally if there's a defect in a ball like a flat spot or something, they wouldn't try to fix it and then sell that ball. And I actually talked
  to a few different engineers who work with metal balls for a living about why one might have a hole later welded closed, and none knew a reason for it. </p>
<p>But one guy said he actually sees balls come from China with single holes in them. And sometimes customers will ask his company to weld them smooth. But most of the engineers said a metal ball like the Betz's could be used in factories to stop
  and allow fluids, which happens with industrial valves like the kind the artist says his ball was intended for. </p>
<p>I was able to track down the artist through his daughter Sabrina. She's actually pictured in a Santa Fe newspaper article kneeling alongside her dad, each of them touching a sphere. She looks about 3 or 4 years old. When we first spoke in
  February, she said her dad is really private and wouldn't give me his contact information. And unfortunately, he did not respond to my many, many emails she said she ran by him, even when I asked if he just could just email me responses and sent
  her questions to relay to him. Nothing. I wanted to know, 'Where did you get these balls? From what area of Jacksonville? Were you driving through? Did your spheres ever follow people around? How could a 20-pound metal ball just fly off your bus?
  Why didn't you stop and retrieve them? And did you ever get around to making that giant clock?'</p>
<p>I decided to check out where the odd ball was supposedly found, according to this anonymous source. Is it likely the ball would have rolled off a bus and wound up there? </p>
<p><strong>[sound of cars whooshing by]</strong> Intern Al Pete and I are parked at a mini strip mall at the intersection of Faye Road and Alta Drive. It's the only building out here. Woods all around us and a railroad track. 'So do you know what is
  what highway that is? Right there?'</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Oh, that's I-295."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"OK, so 295 is the main road here. And other than that, we need to figure out like if Alta Drive and Faye Road, how developed they were then because even right now it's not. There's not too much around
  here. There's really just this one little strip of a diner and a Mexican restaurant."</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Between here and maybe like a mile up, is woods." </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Yeah, so the family said that near this intersection, there was basically a little side road, like a fire road, that you couldn't get to by car that they had to walk to." </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />And down that little road is where she said the ball was allegedly found. Al did a little more digging and got back to me a couple weeks later. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"So how do you sort of characterize this area? It's kind of remote, I guess." </p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Right. If you ride down Hecksher Drive, which is maybe a mile or two south, you see a bunch of fishing. I actually used to fish there. My dad, my step dad used to take us there. So it's a lot of fishing, and
  people just on the bridge. And then after that it's like a row of like, very nice houses. I reached out to Public Works. And they stated that in the '70s that 295 was not built at the time. The Dames Point Bridge, which connects 295, was built
  in1989. So in the 1970s, the only way that you could access that road was Main Street, which is a parallel north-south. So you couldn't get off the highway to get into the area that we were at. It was just woods there. There weren't really too
  many houses there at the time. And if he was coming from up north or down south, the main highway would be 95. Main Street is like a couple of miles away from 95. So just to be candid about it, it would be kind of impossible for this sphere to
  kind of just fall off and roll. I mean, it would have had to roll for a long time to get there."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Yeah. And I mean, that's assuming that it rolled to this area." </p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Assuming, correct." </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"You know, like, that's the thing, because we don't have, you know, a current conversation with him. We're not able to confirm, and he may not even remember, you know, 'Did you get off the highway? Did
  you know people here?'"</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"'Were you going fishing?' That type of thing."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Right. There are so many scenarios, we just don't know. Maybe it would be unlikely if he was just driving through Jacksonville that he would have wound up in that area. But what I'm thinking is, you
  know, this was three years before the sphere was found. Right? So who knows? Like if, if, if someone put it there. Also: three years ago. That would make sense as to why this ball was so beat up."</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Yes, it did have those &mdash; correct." </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"So I don't want to rule it out. But I do think it's a little weird that a really heavy ball would come off someone's van and not hit another car. You would think it would be incredibly noticeable and
  that you would stop and try to get it back unless, you know, it rolled where you couldn't find it."</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"I totally agree. I mean, it's a 20-plus pound ball."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"And he even says in one of the articles, when he's talking about the Betz sphere sort of as a joke. He's like, 'Tell that guy to send the ball over to me. Those things aren't easy to come by.' So it
  seemed like something that was pretty valuable to him."</p>
<p><strong>[Al Pete:]</strong><br />"Right. Yeah, so to me, this seems unlikely, but again, we're not going to rule it out."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />After this conversation, I found an article written by a reporter in New Mexico with some more details. It says Durling-Jones had the spheres and a box on his roof. His trip took them over the highway
  past Jacksonville, and that's where he speculates a few balls escaped from his possession. No indication he actually drove through the area in which the ball was found.</p>
<p>But even with some of these other explanations being floated, an extra terrestrial one was still being investigated. After the break.</p>

<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />At the time the sphere was discovered, the early 70s, the government was taking UFO claims very seriously, as reports of sightings were pouring in from across the country.</p>
<p><strong>[Sci-fi movie clips:]</strong><br /> "They come from another world. Spawned in the light years of space. Unleashed to take over the bodies and souls of the people of our planet." </p>
<p>"Well this sweetheart she married, the man she had known and loved, was merely the hollow shell for the invaders from outer space." </p>
<p>"Bill?!" [woman screams] </p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />Well, I have a reputation as, you know, a calm and reasoned, sophisticated voice on this controversial contentious subject.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Jerry Clark knows a lot about this because he's written three editions of a multi-volume UFO encyclopedia &mdash;</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />&mdash; which is kind of considered the definitive reference work on the subject and won a number of awards. You know, there's a background noise of UFO reports just goes on and on. And every once while erupt
  into what we call a wave, and then the wave actually makes it into the not just the local press but the national and even international press, and then interest goes up. I would say that in terms of popular interest, the 50s 60s were the height of
  popular interest. The height of scientific interest was probably the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Was it your life's work to be researching this? Or did you also have another career?</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />Oh, it kind of ended up taking over my life. Not by design, but that's what happened. The only time that I was drawing an actual paycheck for an extended period of time was I worked for Fate magazine in
  Chicago, and that was kind of a paranormal monthly pulp magazine. And I was associate editor and then senior editor of the magazine for between the mid 70s and the end of the 1980s. And so I'm living testimony that there's no money in UFOs. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Jerry says the modern UFO phenomenon really started the summer of 1947 after a pilot reported seeing a group of disc-shaped objects flying in the sky at a high speed. Other sightings soon followed. And
  just a few months after, the Air Force started an official program called Project Sign looking into the claims.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />Project Sign was the one time that the Air Force was actually at least on the level of the investigators. Lieutenants and captains and staff sergeants who were looking into the sightings, they became convinced
  that these things weren't ours. They weren't Soviet in origin, so they must be from another planet. And in about September 1948, they sent from Project Sign, which was located at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. They sent up an estimate of the
  situation up to the Joint Chiefs that said that the best explanation was visitors from outer space were coming to Earth, and that's what was behind the flying disc reports. And the Joint Chiefs shot that down immediately and demanded that all
  copies of the estimate be burned so that there was no reference to any possibility that for a second, the U.S. government had considered the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation a possibility. And in fact, for years afterwards, the Air Force
  even denied that this estimate of the situation ever existed. But it did exist and eventually the Air Force had to admit it. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Project Sign eventually turned into Project Grudge, which turned into Project Blue Book, the most well known of the three. The goal of them quickly evolved into attaching logical explanations to UFO
  sightings.</p>
<p><strong>[Air Force spokesman in archive audio:]</strong><br />"I'm here to discuss the so-called 'flying saucers.' Air Force interest in this problem has been due to our feeling of an obligation to identify and analyze to the best of our ability
  anything in the air that may have the possibility of threat or menace to the United States."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />This is from a news conference in 1952. Air Force Intelligence Director Major General John Samford is talking.</p>
<p><strong>[Samford continues:]</strong><br /> "We have received and analyzed between 1- and 2,000 reports that have come to us from all kinds of sources. Of this great mass of reports we have been able adequately to explain the great bulk of them."
</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />The scientific consultant they hired to do that explaining was J. Allen Hynek, a professor of astronomy and UFO skeptic.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />He was the guy that was brought on early on like in the late 40s to look at reports that might have an astronomical explanation. And he was the nearest astronomer to Dayton, Ohio. He was at Ohio State
  University at the time. And then Hynek got sucked into it, and for pretty much the next decade and a half, he pretty much he echoed the Air Force line, even though privately he was having growing doubts that this was a productive approach and
  would sometimes voice them privately or even publicly. But he didn't come out as an actual active UFO proponent until the mid 1960s. And then he immediately became the most famous UFO proponent in the world.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Project Blue Book closed down in 1969. But Hynek went on to start the Center for UFO Studies to keep investigating claims, including the Betz sphere. See, this all ties in. </p>
<p>The National Enquirer had assembled a team of five scientists, a blue ribbon panel of UFO investigators. It was offering a cash prize to anyone who produced a UFO. The panel happened to be meeting at a New Orleans conference in late April of '74.
  The Betz ball first made headlines in mid April, so naturally, they went ahead and took a look at it. The panelists were Hynek, an astronomer; Robert Cregan, a professor of philosophy; Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist; Frank Salisbury, a plant
  physiologist; and James Harder, a civil engineer. Six days after the ball's initial headlines, a South Florida newspaper reported that Gerri said her son Terry, who found the ball, was picked up by a private plane and taken to the National
  Enquirer's offices in Lantana, Florida, a pit stop before heading to New Orleans for the conference. The following day, a Tampa newspaper published a story about the ball's time at the headquarters. There, employees nicknamed the ball Edward and
  kept it in a safe. Then, on a table on the National Enquirer's lawn, the ball rolled on its own slowly around a table that was not quite level, even rolling over the uphill portion with no apparent difficulty. The article just states this with no
  attribution so it's not clear if the reporter witnessed it or if they were told about it. </p>
<p>And remember, according to that guy, Dick, Gerri's friend I spoke to in Episode1, things got even weirder here.</p>
<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]</strong><br />"Gerri sent Terry and Robin, her two sons, to fly down there with it, and they were going to fly back with it. Well, after a day or so, the people sent the two boys back and kept the ball. And I don't think
  that was the way it was supposed to work. But that's what happened. But they finally got the ball back."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"We had that conversation in 2017. And two years later&hellip;" </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "Hold on, let me find my notes." </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Remember, this is Nan, the editor who profiled Gerri in First Coast Magazine. "So, you talked to Gerri on Monday?"</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "I did. I tracked down her info and gave her a call. And I forgot. I forgot what a wonderful, eloquent woman she is. You know, she's just remarkable. And she was really happy to hear from me. She really
  enjoyed the article. I hadn't spoken to her since we did the article in 2016. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Nan mentioned to Gerri the sphere had come up in a recent news article. And Gerri just started talking&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "&hellip;for 30 minutes. Just totally went back in time and just recalled all these details from that, that period of time, </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />including the ball being taken to this blue ribbon panel of UFO investigators. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> Somewhere in that window of time someone who was organizing the panel told her son that his mother had been calling and needed him to return home. So he called her and tried to get ahold of her but could
  not. The Betz's phone had been ringing off the hook for weeks since this whole thing kind of blew up. So the National Enquirer flew them &mdash; there's a plane waiting for them and flew them back to Florida. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Wait, like a private plane?</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> A private plane. And when they arrived, Gerri was like, 'What are you guys doing here?' And they're like, 'They said that you were trying to get ahold of us.' And she's like, 'No!' </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Nan and Dick's versions are slightly different. Nan was under the impression Terry went directly to New Orleans. But Dick in the newspaper said he was first flown to South Florida, and that's where he
  separated from the ball. But either way, allegedly, Terry is separated from the ball, which winds up in New Orleans at this panel. That part of the story lines up.</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> They go back and they request copies of everything they've done and all the, whatever, information about what they've been doing to the sphere in that window of time they were gone. The scientists were not
  willing to share any of that. So in the middle of this panel, Terry Betz just stands up, takes the sphere and walks out and leaves, gets in his car and takes off back to Florida. And Gerri was like, 'I don't think any of them were expecting him to
  do that. It was very abrupt.' </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Did she share if they ever got to the bottom of who was behind this weird sick call?</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> No. I mean, she felt like it was someone involved with that panel. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Of the five panelists, the majority have passed away.</p>
<p><strong>[phone rings.]</strong> "Hello, WJCT, this is Lindsey."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />But I was able to get in touch with Leo Sprinkle, the psychologist.</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />I enjoyed my work on the panel. But what I really enjoyed was getting to meet so many interesting people who had described their experiences.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He says the panel was active between 1972 and '79. And probably the reason it existed was to increase sales of National Enquirer papers. But he and his colleagues were real scientists and did real work
  looking into lots of claims. At the time, the prize for anyone who could prove extra terrestrial existence would win 50 grand. The Betzes didn't want any cash. </p>
<p>LK on phone: "It was 1974. And the panel looked at the Betz sphere in New Orleans. Do you have any recollection of that specific object?"</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />"I'm sorry, I don't. I'm sure it was important at the time, but my memory is faulty. And so I don't, I don't recall. Can you tell me a little bit more about it? Was it a large sphere or handheld?"</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Yeah. So, the Navy said it was stainless steel. They had looked at it before the panel&hellip;" </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I tell him about the vibrating, the rolling, and the even more out-there allegations, like Terry's allegedly being separated from the ball and its rolling up hill just before heading to the conference.
</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"I mean, does any of that ring a bell?"</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />"It's a beautiful case. I'm sorry that I can't contribute anything to it."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />He repeatedly tells me his memory just isn't what it used to be, that this doesn't mean the ball didn't do anything remarkable. But no, he doesn't remember it. Forty-five years was a long time ago. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"Do you think if it had rolled up hill in this way, that that's something you would have remembered?"</p>
<p><strong>[Leo Sprinkle:]</strong><br />"I would think &mdash; you know, I used to pride myself on my memory. Now, I'm sorry, I just don't have any recall about the experience."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Through Nan, Gerri had lots more to say. She addressed what Dick told me two years prior: that before the ball headed to South Florida and then New Orleans, in Jacksonville, the Navy took a look at it and
  wanted to keep it. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> The officer came to her home to return the sphere. The Navy had it for two weeks. And the same day he was supposed to come, the naval base called her home, and I think the name of the officer &mdash;</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />I think it's Chris Berninger. He's the spokesperson in all the articles about it. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> The Navy called her home before he got there and said, 'Is Officer Berninger there?' She said no. And he said, 'Well, as soon as he arrives, please have him call' and give him our number. And she said, 'OK,
  no problem.' So he got there and she let him know that the base was trying to get ahold of him. So he called the base and she said that she could tell from the phone call that whatever it was, was very serious. She said it was very much like,
  'Yes, sir. Yes, sir.' And then he got off and he asked for the sphere back. He wanted to take it back to the base. And she wouldn't let him. She said, 'No, I'm sorry. This belongs to us and we're keeping it,' which is such a brave thing to do, you
  know? </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Most people would say the Navy is asking for this back. I have to comply. </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> Right. She doesn't know what the conversation was, but they wanted it back.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Nan and Dick's versions from Gerri, two years apart, are pretty consistent. Dick even brought up a specific scientist who came to the family's home to research the ball after the panel.</p>
<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]</strong><br />And there was a pretty well-known professor. He asked permission to come and see the ball and sleep with it. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />That well-known professor was J. Allen Hynek.</p>
<p><strong>[Jerry Clark:]</strong><br />The most famous UFO proponent in the world.</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />Yeah, the guy the government hired to debunk UFO claims and later joined the UFO panel along with Sprinkle, who we just heard from. Nan clarified what Dick meant by Hynek's sleeping with the ball.</p>
<p><strong>[Dick Burnett:]</strong><br />"I don't think they got married."</p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> Hynek reached out. He wanted them to come to Chicago. She said, 'No, if you want to see the sphere, you're gonna have to come to us.' So he came. And she said that he was just a delightful person, they
  enjoyed their time together. He was only there for a couple days. He asked if he could, you know, bring the sphere into his bedroom overnight. And she didn't really see any harm in that. She trusted him, you know, he was a government scientist,
  with, you know, with a very staunch reputation. </p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />"So you did bring up the fact that I want to talk to her?" </p>
<p><strong>[Nan Kavanaugh:]</strong><br /> "I did, I did. I said that you had read the First Coast Magazine article, you are very interested in her as a person. And you were also interested in the sphere and being transparent about that. But, you
  know, that you're a fantastic journalist and dedicated to the city and, you know, just telling the human side of how this, really how this affected, you know, the family more so than some crazy, you know, supernatural story. And she was very, she
  was very gracious about it. But she was like, 'Nan, I just don't feel comfortable really sharing this with anyone,' she said, 'with anyone but you,' and I was like kind of flabbergasted. I was like, 'Thank you so much, Gerri.' You know, we just
  did that one little story on her in that window of time."</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey Kilbride:]</strong><br />This was a huge bummer. Because I think talking to Gerri is really important. At the same time, I understand she may just not want to talk. I get that. Through this whole process, I've lost a lot of sleep
  over if I'm digging up too much, if I'm doing more damage than good. So I think selfishly, I kind of want Gerri's blessing that I'm telling this the right way, that I get it. And I don't know if that's going to happen. But she is the key to this
  story about what this kind of thing does to a person's life, to a family. Nan told me she'd give it another shot. So don't worry, I'm not giving up yet. </p>
<p>But as far as this Hynek situation, there are so many articles announcing the ball would be going to this panel in New Orleans, but not a whole lot laying out the panel's findings or confirming Hynek performed any kind of study at Gerri's house.
</p>
<p>But I did find an old interview of Hynek right after returning from the panel.</p>
<p><strong>[Archive sound:]</strong><br /> "Let me ask you first, Professor Hynek, about your latest evaluations of the sphere. Do you consider this now extraterrestrial or Earth-manufactured?"</p>

<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />From WJCT Public Media, this is Episode 2 of Odd Ball. I'm Lindsey Kilbride.</p>
[Montage of clips from previous episode:]
<p><strong>Ron Kivett: </strong> "One of my listeners called up and said, 'Ron, have you heard about this thing that they found?' And I said, 'OK, well, you know, I'll check it out.'" "Sitting on a glass top table, the ball rolled from the center of the table all the way to the edge and stopped.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey:</strong> "Do you remember your dad saying that he personally witnessed it?"</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong><br />"Yes."</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />"And then at the end, they weren't sure that they got the right ball back even." "People will say you're crazy or this or that, but she is not."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />I left off talking with Betz family friend Dick Burnett in his living room &mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />"This is the bottom jaw of a woolly mammoth right here&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />&mdash; about his memories of the odd ball and his more recent conversations with Gerri, matriarch of the Betz household. Dick skimmed over some weird details about several UFO investigators.</p>
<p>Looking at the ball and the Navy's involvement, the Navy investigated the ball just days after it made headlines and April 1974. I haven't had any luck getting the official report. But newspapers say they had two weeks to investigate the ball and determined it was from Earth because it was made out of super common stainless steel. And that's despite the witnesses' and family's account of its odd behavior: vibrating and seeming to move around of its own volition. Gerri says something mysterious was going on with the officer in charge of returning the ball and he wanted to take it back. But she said no.</p>
<p>I have to say, going into this, I personally find it highly unlikely the ball's anything magical or extraterrestrial. And I totally believe a life beyond Earth is possible, even likely, but I'm still coming into this really skeptical if this was something truly astounding.</p>
<p>Wouldn't the Navy have just said it was government property, something classified? You know, not give Gerri the option of taking it back? I don't know. But everyone I've spoken to who knows Gerri says she's smart, well respected and honest. So I wanted to know more about that. Who is Gerri? Is she the kind of person who would either make up weird things about the ball? Or imagine them?</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong> <br />"She's a pretty extraordinary woman who has an amazing history that people probably don't know."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Nan Kavanaugh is the former editor of First Coast Magazine, which profiled Gerri Betz and 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"It took me a long time to track her down. I think after the Betz sphere, she and her family, they, over the past few decades, they've just been inundated with UFO enthusiasts trying to track them down that they've kind of gone into hiding in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"So tell me a little bit about your journey and getting in touch with her and how she came on your radar as someone you wanted to interview.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"There was a gentleman who lived on the Northside of Jacksonville who fancied himself as a kind of local hobby historian. And he, he's the type of guy who writes letters to the newspaper all the time, really long, intense letters."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"So you were familiar with him."</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"I was familiar with him. So he would just call me, like every, I don't know, three months, every six months with, like, some story ideas. I had asked him, through one of our conversations, 'We're doing an October issue, we'd really like to focus on the supernatural. Do you have any good stories?' And that's when he said, 'Oh, you should do something on the Betz sphere.' So then I went into the archive of the Times-Union and found the file and the stories on it and Googled it online. I was like, 'Wow, that is a supernatural occurrence that people are still really like, fixated on, and so I was like, 'This is great.' And then I was like, 'OK, well, let's try to find the Betz family,' and so I began that process and it was more challenging than I expected because Gerri had such a prominent &mdash; she was a prominent figure in the 70s and 60s."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />She's not kidding. Remember how he said the newspaper had this thick archive of articles related to the sphere? That same folder includes 24 articles just on Gerri, most of them predating the ball's discovery. People around here knew who she was. It also includes a stack of photos of Gerri. She's petite with brunette hair cut short or pulled back when she sat for portraits. My favorite photo of her is this one where she looks really young. Her hair is pulled back in a low ponytail, and she's got some frizzy fly always because Florida, but she's candidly laughing while trying to compose herself for the portrait. I just like it.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"She was a business owner. Their family are large landowners in the area. She was very active in local politics."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Lots of coverage is about her fighting the city over its buying a private bus company. She argued it would obligate the city to high costs without voters' having a say. She led an effort collecting signatures to have the City Council members removed who supported the purchase. Then she was a plaintiff in a state Supreme Court case over the matter. One article spotlighted Gerri for refusing to answer questions posed by city lawyers about her research into the private bus company's finances, saying she would not disclose her source even if it meant jail. Other articles alleged City Council members may have been retaliating against her over the matter. Then there's her run for Soil and Water Board, her demonstrating for higher pay for police, and her run for a state House seat, although she didn't win.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"So I was kind of surprised when I started trying to find them through just normal means of searches that I was unable to really find any real information, contact information like, no social media accounts, nothing that I could really see. And eventually tracked them down through tax records got ahold of one of her nieces, who when I called her she was very suspicious of about me calling. And I quickly realized that if I was going to ask the family anything about the Betz sphere, I was not going to get anywhere with the family. So realizing through my research of Gerri as a person, I was like, let's shift gears here, like, there's a nature preserve named for them. And near the Fort George area, there was a large piece of land that they donated, that's Tiger Point Preserve, and they've donated a lot of land to the state for preservation."</p>
<p>"One of the things that the magazine was trying to do is that kind of highlight unknown and untold histories, so I was like, you know what, people go to this, go to this park all the time, they use the ramp. They probably have no idea who the family is, so let's do a story on Gerri and celebrate the work she did and what an amazing business person she was to acquire that land and the vision she had and her choice to preserve it. So that was the story that I pitched the family, and that was the story that they finally were like, 'OK, like, we'll share Gerri's phone number with you.'"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Reporter Karen Burmeister wrote that story in 2016 titled "Gutsy and Gifted: The amazing Gerri Betz Jackson." The deal? A story about Gerri's life and work. No mention of the ball allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"She's truly a self-made woman because she grew up in such poverty and on a farm in South Georgia, and she was one of 14 children. Her parents &mdash; her mom died first and then her father died. I think a few years later, when she was quite young, want to say maybe around 10, 11, 12 when they died, and so she took care of her younger siblings and, you know, they had no electricity, no running water. They had to bring in pails of water from a well that was somewhere on the property. And she I think was born with&nbsp; a talent for taking care of people and helping people. She has a big heart."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"It sounds like she's pretty resourceful, just sort of working with what she had.</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"Oh my gosh, yeah. She got married early. And I think that it wasn't a really successful marriage. And the husband was falling behind in his payments for this truck with a trailer behind it and was about to go into default. I think she saw that that could be developed into a successful business."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />In 1965, her business success was featured in the newspaper, "Jacksonville Mother of 6 Built Trucking Line from 1 Repossession." She was 32 at the time. 32, raising six kids. It describes her as "an attractive brunette with dark hair, glamour white teeth, and"&mdash; I can not believe I'm saying this &mdash; "the figure of a school girl." Later, when she ran for a state House seat along with lots of other women in 1972, that headline was "If These Women Candidates are Elected, How Will They Keep House?" Yikes.</p>
<p>Anyway, this article says she took over payments of the nearly new tractor trailer from a young man she had tried to help by signing his bank loan, not specifying it was her soon-to-be ex-husband. Whoever it came from she tried to sell it but with offers too low, she instead found use for it, hiring a driver, scoring a twice-a-week route to Miami hauling poultry. But then that company wanted to give her all its business. Having only one truck, she went around to truck stops in search of independent drivers looking for extra work. Within five years she had remarried, had that sixth child and purchased her ninth truck. Again, reporter Caren Burmeister:</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"The trucks would break down on the highway, and the driver would call her and say, you know, something's wrong with it. And so she would probe him with questions and&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />And actually helped the driver fix his truck over the phone based on her own research into diesel engines. She did her own bookkeeping, scrubbed the trucks every week, and she said she made more than 100 calls a day acquainting people with her service. She said most big food chains refused to even consider her company because she was a woman. And she did most of this by herself. Her husband, a marine engineer, wasn't home much but offered moral support, according to the article. She said at the time, you had to let men speak for you to keep the peace, but sometimes you had to stir it up.</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"Around that time, she was also buying land whenever she could. She told me that even when she was, like, in her very early or late teens or maybe even early 20s, she was saving every penny she could to buy land, and that really paid off for her later."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Not only did she donate land for preservation, Caren says, she was successful in real estate and she also had a knack for engineering, because of course she did.</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"She loved self study. She would buy books, and she would pick people's brains and talk with people and study and she would just figure things out on her own."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Gerri largely credits her intuition, which she told Caren some may label as clairvoyance. But Gerri calls it her gift.</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"I said, I understand that you, you know, have a very strong faith and a close relationship with God. But I think that it goes even beyond that. You have special gifts. And she's like, 'Yeah.' She didn't want to brag. She's very humble and very down to earth. She would just have these real strong instincts or gut feelings."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />For instance, one time she was with a group of people and they were doing a devotional study&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"&hellip;in this, I think it was like a wooden facility."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />It was dusk, and an inner voice told her, 'Turn off the lights.'</p>
<p><strong>Caren Burmeister: </strong><br />"So she flipped off the lights and that's when she looked out the window and she could see what at first she thought was fog. Then she looked more closely and realized it was smoke&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />&hellip;because the building was on fire. So Gerri believes she has a gift, like a sixth sense. Her gut told her to turn off the lights and she was able to see that the part of the building she was in was on fire. When I asked Caren what she thinks about all this, without skipping a beat, she says she believes her. I don't know what to think. Except I find it really intriguing, especially with everything she's accomplished.</p>
<p>Caren's article really gives you a sense of who Gerri is and that this discovery of a weird silver ball not mentioned in the article, it was just a blip. But you wouldn't know that by searching her name online. That just brings up a bunch of theories about the sphere.</p>
<p>Back in mid-April '74 when articles about the ball were popping up daily, Gerri's portrayal seems to shift over the course of 10 days or so.</p>
<p><strong>Al Pete:</strong><br />"Shift from what to what?"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"So in this first article I could find it explains the ball exhibited strange behavior. It talks about the Navy's being interested in the ball, and it says several people have advanced the theory it may be a bugging device left by a UFO. The next day the paper's own photographer is quoted backing up Gerri's claims, and the Navy spokesman admits there is something weird about the ball.</p>
<p>Then the Navy determined the ball was made on Earth and not odd. And the way Gerri is portrayed seems to change at this point. This is where I've noticed it, because then, we start seeing headlines like this one right here: "Just a ball? Maybe not, Sat Its Finders" So it's sort of doubting&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Al Pete:</strong><br />"Yeah, it's definitely a downplay. Yeah."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"And that's how it kind of progresses. So a few days later, there's an article that says Gerri and her family 'won't give up the notion' it's from outer space. But Gerri is like, 'You still haven't told me what it is or where it came from.' And that's what I want to know. So the articles go from saying, the Navy thinks the ball is strange to the ball did not roll around at the Air Station when being x-rayed by the Navy.</p>
<p>So then a couple months later, there's another article and it states, 'the Betzes still believe stainless steel globe came from outer space.' And then in the article, she claims that people were trying to buy the ball, including a group offering 750 grand, which she said she turned down, that she's had to have people wanting to investigate it kicked off her property and that she's taken serious security precautions to protect the ball.</p>
<p>So as more and more as being reported about the sphere, Gerri seems less and less into the attention. You know, if she just wanted this to all go away, she could probably just say it stopped moving around, or, I was mistaken. The Navy was right. It's just a metal ball made on Earth. But she doesn't. So she's either really honest or really dedicated to a contrived story. Listening to this call with Ron, that radio host who took pictures of the ball, she says this ball has completely disrupted her family life with all the people wanting to see it and study it.</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz in archive phone call:]</strong><br />"I'll tell you one thing. This thing has disrupted my family life all to heck."</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />"I would imagine so."</p>
<p><strong>Gerri Betz:</strong><br />"&hellip;24 hours a day and it means nothing to people in the West that it's midnight here. And when they quit calling, those in the East wake up and start."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />She told a reporter that if she had known what she knows now, she wouldn't have told anyone what her son found. She would have kept quiet.</p>
<p>Then, a second ball popped up. But first&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>[Promo:] </strong><br />Odd Ball is made possible by supporters of WJCT Public Media with additional support from Bold Bean Coffee Roasters. Although Bold Bean typically focuses on single-origin coffees, owner Zack Burnett created a special Odd Ball blend at his roastery in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
[Zack with machinery humming in background:] "So Odd Ball is a two-coffee blend. One of the blend elements comes from El Salvador. The coffees were grown on the Santa Ana volcano. It's from a family that we've been working with for going on five years. So that coffee on its own is pretty well rounded and balanced. The second component of that blend is a coffee called Kiamabara from Kenya. So we've used that coffee to kind of spice up the blend, give it a lot of character and then balance that kind of intensity out with the El Salvador. The Odd Ball is tasting a lot like luxardo cherries, like cocktail cherries. And that's kind of balanced out by a nice kind of spice note similar to, like, root beer."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Get the coffee blends now and find out how to binge all the Odd Ball episodes before they're officially released at oddballpodcast.com.

<p><strong>[Kickstarter promo:] </strong><br />"It can feel like brilliant, creative ideas just appear out of nowhere, you know, like a mysterious metal ball from outer space. But of course, it's never that simple. Kickstarter's podcast Just the Beginning brings you stories about how independent creators bring their ideas to life. And sometimes those ideas are a little out there. 'My dad and I built a little holographic studio in my room. It was right at the foot of my bed in high school. I think it was the only one on the block.' That's inventor Sean Frane, who stuck with his childhood obsession and created a desktop holographic display called the Looking Glass.

<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Just over a week after the ball made its first headlines, an official with the St. Regis Pulp and Paper Co. in Jacksonville made his own headlines, saying the Betz sphere is probably part of a ball valve his company used to use in the process of converting wood chips into pulp. He said that equipment had been discarded 15 years ago, probably sold as scrap, and there's no telling where it all ended up.</p>
<p>Then a woman named Lottie Robinson came forward with a second ball. She said this ball had been sitting in her garage for about 15 years. A family friend had apparently given a heavy metal ball to her kids to play with, as you do. It was 8 inches in diameter, like the Betz sphere. 20 pounds: a tad lighter than the Betzes'. And if you rolled it, there's a little thing in there kind of like the Betz sphere.</p>
<p>Then a local businessman who sells metal balls and the GM of a plant that makes metal balls both said the two spheres definitely seem like the kind they're familiar with using in machinery for pulp mills and chemical pumps.</p>
<p>That general manager I just mentioned was from the Michigan company Industrial Tectonics, which is still around today, still specializing in the making of metal balls. In '74, he said that little jingle you hear inside the Betz ball, it's probably from pieces of metal that could have fallen into a small hole left after the ball was cast and sealed.</p>
<p>Some articles do say the ball had like this welded-over plug. Most don't mention that.</p>
<p>I reached out to Industrial Tectonics and the guy spoke with said this: The process of making metal balls hasn't really changed since before the 70s. Typically, two hemispheres are welded together, but you'd never be able to tell. And he couldn't think of a reason a metal sphere would have a hole drilled and later welded over. He also said you wouldn't want little shards of material falling inside the ball but it could happen if it was poorly manufactured. And he agrees with the officials who chimed in and said that a ball matching the Betz sphere description could be used in pulp mills and chemical pumps. A hollow metal ball like this would be strong but not too heavy.</p>
<p>But back in this article from '74 it says a PR rep with a paper mill actually confirmed the lady's ball &mdash; that's the woman who had to look-alike &mdash; was once one of the mill's. Although the article doesn't specify the mill really took a look at lady's ball but it says to ID the Betz ball, paper company engineers would have to take a look at it. And that's where things get cloudy because I don't know if that ever happened. There's no follow up news story, and the paper plant has been shut down.</p>
<p>We know the ball fits the description of the mill's spheres, except, you know, theirs didn't vibrate and follow people around. But I know Gerri says her ball was not part of the mill's equipment, or so she told Ron. Her sentiment can best be summed up as, "It's not from the paper mill. I've confirmed that with a UFO investigator. But let people think that. I don't want to be bothered anymore."</p>
<p>A year and a half later, Gerri sat down with a Florida Times-Union newspaper reporter, Sandy Strickland.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"How long have you been what this paper?"</p>
<p>Sandy Strickland: "I came in December of 1969. And that means I've been here longer than anyone else."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />And she's still there. I wanted to hear about her interview with Gerri but also track down other reporters who also may have known Gerri.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"These are all people who wrote about her."</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"She's dead. She's dead. He's dead. Terry Murphy. Terry Murphy is still with us. And she is a Facebook friend."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />So basically, I was extremely lucky to have Sandy, who interviewed Gerri in 1975. I brought a scanned copy of the original article with me.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"You know, I know what it feels like to read a story I wrote four years ago and cringe because I'm like, 'Oh god.' How do you feel about this?"</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"Oh, I don't like to read my stories once they've been in print, because then you see things that you would have written differently. And you want to cut out some words and you want to add and then you think, 'Oh, I could have said it this way.' And then the writing style was different then too. I can write better than this now.</p>
<p>But I remember going to the house. They wanted a Halloween story. And this seemed to fit within the parameters."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Sandy went to Gerri's place, which is this gigantic house sitting in the woods, and the house is complete with one of those rounded side towers like, you know, what castles have.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"If you went up to the tower, you could look out and you could almost see the inlet, I think you could see the inlet. I remember all these levels, and you would walk, you know ,from one to the other, and it seemed &mdash; it was a neat house. I've never been in another house like it. They called it 'the castle.' And indeed it did look like a castle. And I remember, as I said, the orange shag carpet and they were &mdash; it was just the kind of house that you could have a great party in. You could play hide and go seek and never be found.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />21 rooms: Six bedrooms, a master lounge, a Florida room, garden room, play room, shop, den, a 20-foot closet, a basement built like a dungeon. But Sandy didn't interview Gerri to profile a neat house, she profiled a rumored haunted house. The article was headlined "Haunted House? Fort George Mansion has Aura of Mystery.</p>
[Sounds of nature along with eerie music]
[Lindsey, reading from Sandy's story:] "Trees hump across the narrow, twisting road that leads to the house. On foggy days, a mist seems to emanate from around the house. [sounds of poultry] Chickens and ducks chatter in the yard, adding an incongruous note to the haunted castle atmosphere."</p>
<p>I don't agree with Sandy. Her writing is great.</p>
<p>Over the years, there had been stories that organ music could be heard&nbsp;throughout the house, but no organ. When the house was vacant, there were tales of mysterious phone calls, lights, voices, banging doors, a rumored secret passage never found by the house's occupants.</p>
<p>Once during a party, guests were sitting in the library with all the doors locked, when a crash was heard in the kitchen. Broken dishes were on the floor, but the cabinet was closed.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"She took me around and she showed me some of the places where some of the strange events had occurred. And the cabinet, for example, where some of the glass and china was stored, and there was no one in that room when it crashed, and there was no reason for it to crash. And then the doors. The double doors that led to the house, those were heavy doors. They were either made of metal or wood or stone and they would not blow open, and yet&nbsp;they opened. And there were strange noises. There were crashing sounds, telephones would ring."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />A maid decided she didn't want to work at the house anymore. Once, a guest heard a heavy door slam and was reluctant to come back. But Gerri said she's always tried to look for logical explanations. Voices? Maybe they just carried over from boaters in the inlet.</p>
<p>Sandy's story just has brief mention of the sphere. I asked what she remembered about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"I don't think anyone thought that it dropped from outer space, that it had anything to do with extraterrestrials or alien objects or anything of that nature, you know. The mind is a powerful thing and you can let your imagination run wild to the fact that you might say, 'I wouldn't want to be alone in a room with that ball at night all by myself.'"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />So on one hand Gerri says all the attention with the ball totally disrupted her family's life and although she personally didn't think the ball was from the paper mill, she was glad that theory was floating around, because maybe it would make people lose interest...yet a year later she agrees to be interviewed about rumors her house was haunted. This is sort of a red flag for me, honestly.</p>
<p>And it's not hard to see how the house could trigger your imagination &hellip; if you can find it.</p>
[Driving sound] [Lindsey and her friend Nyah are in the car]
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br /> "We're on Ft. George Road, we're about to turn on Ft. George Road. So hopefully it's not that hard to find." </p>
<p><strong>[Nyah laughs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Again, my friend Nyah.</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"Check this out. Here we go. Maybe we gotta...nope&hellip; you're going to go up here past the slave house and veer left at the.."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />The Betzes' old house is really close to Kingsley Plantation, which has intact slave houses &ndash; if the place weren't already eerie.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"It should be right up here."</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"Maybe we have to turn" Lindsey Kilbride: "OK, there's a gate...OK let's. It says it's a little further up but it might be that? "</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />It wasn't. Google didn't know where the house was, and neither did we.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Gilmore:</strong><br />"The house was built in the late 1920s by Mellen Greeley, who was a prolific Jacksonville architect. He was called the Dean of Jacksonville Architects at one time, and he built it for a real estate person in Chicago names Nettleton Neff."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Local historian and English Professor Tim Gilmore describes the house as "soaked in suicide and abandonment."</p>
<p><strong>Tim Gilmore:</strong><br />"Neff's wife died in a fire at their summer home in Michigan and 1926. A couple years later Neff's 21-year-old son went missing.&nbsp;He was found two weeks later, he had hung himself in an apple tree in Connecticut."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Nettleton Neff himself&nbsp;?</p>
<p><strong>Tim Gilmore:</strong><br />"Committed suicide in his office in Chicago, he shot himself. And he never lived in the house. And this was the late 1920s. And, you know, this is right before, kind of the economic bust and the Great Depression. And nobody lived in the house full time until 1967."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />The Betz family.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Gilmore:</strong><br />"And no one has lived there since. The National Park Service has it boarded up."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Totally weird, but I don't think it's connected to the ball. And Gerri says all the haunted stuff predated the sphere's discovery. Still, it's alluring&hellip; like, oh, a family found this rumored UFO, and they lived in a possibly haunted house near an old plantation ... totally normal...</p>
[Lindsey in car with Nyah:] "I'm just going to ask this guy if he knows. [rolls window down&gt; 'I have a question. Do you live out here? You don't? We're trying to find this mansion that's back here somewhere. The Neff house?'&hellip; You think that's it?"</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"You know I was kind of curious about that myself&hellip;This cannot be right&hellip;.They meant it when they said no trespassing. I thought the no trespassing was more of a suggestion."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"Nope."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />The house captured Tim's imagination so much that he wrote a Southern-gothic style short story about some teens who find it in the woods. This description from the story ultimately helped us find the house:</p>
[Tim Gilmore reading his story:] "Then he walked off the hiking trail past the No Trespassing sign. He was walking on an old dirt road that dipped through a narrow ravine and rose up small hills. The sun came through two trees that framed a house in the near distance. When he got closer, he could tell the corner of the house was a brick tower. At least three, maybe four stories tall. The sun glinted off the conical roof like a diamond. When he got closer, he saw the windows were boarded up. A curved iron railing semi-circled the balcony over an address above the door. The address said "01." He thought it might be missing some numbers. He also thought the road had no name. What was the house address here on this road with no name, just 01? As though it were the only house or the first house in the world? He circled the house looking for a way inside.&nbsp;He wanted to stand on that balcony. He wanted to be in that tower. He imagined stairs inside spiraling three-and-a-half stories upward nestled against the interior round brick wall."</p>
[Nyah and Lindsey:] "I think this is it. You coming or staying? Lindsey Kilbride: "I'll stay."</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"I'll be back&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />We stop at the end of a gated off, narrow road and I did not believe it led to the house, but 15 minutes later.</p>
[Nyah and Lindsey:] "This is it!" </p><p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"It is?! We found the house!"</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"Google did not help. Our intuition did not help."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />We walk along a curved path, no house in sight for several minutes.</p>
[Sound from woods:] </p><p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"Wow&hellip; wow"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />It's the house. A 21-room castle, boarded up. Half brick, half stucco with a circular tower adorned with a pointed roof.</p>
[Sound from woods:]
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"This is where it all happened. </p><p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />This is the door. This is the door that Dick walked up to, and I can imagine him coming out here and talking to Gerri."</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"&hellip;While the kids are inside&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"Playing with this alien&hellip;"</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />"If we were to try to get in this, it would be very precarious&hellip; this is definitely the type of area that inspires paranormal thinking and supernatural stuff, in your house that's built to be called a castle."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"The place looks haunted, for sure. I mean it's just crazy to me that there's this huge mansion in this beautiful area and it's just abandoned, boarded up."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: [In studio]</strong><br />"From your recollection, did things change for Gerri and her reputation after the sphere was found?"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Sandy, the newspaper reporter, says she thinks the Betz family eventually shied away from discussing the ball because maybe people started looking at them in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"I don't think it did, because she had she became very successful after that. I think that many things that she touched, she just had the ability to make successes of them, and I don't think things changed for her that much other than family being besieged, and I think that made them just want to shy away from discussing the ball. You know maybe people were looking at them in a different way."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride: </strong><br />"Yeah, to me it made me wonder, you know Gerri, she was such a great business woman, she was really smart, she wasn't afraid to challenge, you know, City Council, if they were wasting taxpayer dollars in her opinion. And then the sphere came, and it seemed like that's what people were knowing her for. And to me, it's like, that's such a small part of who she is. Why are we not focusing on her as this really powerful, cool woman in the community?</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Strickland:</strong><br />"I think that's exactly what happened. I think they&mdash; some even dubbed it 'the Betz ball.'"</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />Nan,&nbsp; the editor who decided to profile Gerri a couple of years ago, agrees, she wasn't someone who would have been in it for the attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"It really was eye-opening to me&nbsp;to really think about a person's experience once something supernatural has occurred&nbsp;and you share it, right? And you don't just keep it to yourself. How that can uproot everything. People were, like, coming here from all over the country on a pilgrimage to their home, and it got crazy. You know, there's nothing in it for Gerri Betz to share this strange story. She had everything.</p>
<p>Nan also corroborates some of what Gerri's friend Dick told me. She says the Navy tried to keep the ball as an officer was returning it to the Betz family and that Gerri doesn't know if she even ended up with the original ball. Like, one of these UFO investigators maybe switched it out.</p>
<p>That's what Gerri told her the last time they talked, a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"I want to learn more. I&nbsp;want to try to get down there and visit with her."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />About a week after this interview, Nan came back to the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Kilbride:</strong><br />"So you talked to Gerri on Monday?" </p>
<p><strong>Nan Kavanaugh:</strong><br />"I did."</p>

And in Jacksonville, Florida, a family finds this weird silver-colored ball near their house.</p>
<p><strong>[Archive news tape:] [male anchor:]</strong><br />
“The Betz family found the ball in a wooded area north of Heckscher Drive two weeks ago and have been trying to figure out what it is ever since. Navy ordnance experts picked up the ball this morning but not before signing a receipt. In fact, Mrs. Betz is so concerned, she's considering insuring the ball with Lloyds of London.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
What? That one doesn't ring a bell.</p>
<p>From WJCT Public Media in Jacksonville, this is <em>Odd Ball</em>, a story about a UFO investigation, a mansion in the woods, and how one shiny object silenced a family. I'm Lindsey Kilbride.</p>
<p>In the middle of April 1974, headlines started popping up in newspapers all over the country about this heavy silver sphere a Jacksonville man found in the woods. It was about the size of a bowling ball and would roll around seemingly with a mind of its own. Today, there's still no consensus as to what the ball was, where it came from, or even who has it today. And it's not easy to get some of those answers because the family has been mostly silent over the last few decades. So why was it never IDd? And where did it come from? Can we put this mystery to rest? I'm going to try.</p>
<p>Ron Kivett: “These are just some photographs. This is a photograph of the ball itself, the mystery sphere.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
I start off talking to Ron Kivett, who photographed the ball shortly after it was found. He's pulling out lots of pictures of the ball from this manila folder he brought.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“And this is you with it?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Ron used to have some very on-trend, long sideburns. But most of these photos are close ups of the sphere. It's a metal ball covered in scratches, a little smaller than a standard bowling ball by about a half-inch. He has the ball set up on this mini pedestal against a backdrop of what looks like red velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Where did you set this up?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“At their house. At the Betz property.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
In ‘74, Ron was hosting a local radio show, which was called Tales of Strange Things.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“And we talked about UFOs, we talked about ghosts and flying saucers and all kinds of things like that. And periodically, some of my listeners would call in and say, ‘Oh, Ron, have you seen this?’ or, ‘Have you heard about this?’ And they’d give me a tip on something, and I'd go out and investigate it. One of my listeners called up. He said, ‘Ron, have you heard about this thing that they found up—’ and he was kind of saying, you know, it's this big ball of some kind, and I said, ‘OK, well, you know, I'll check it out.’</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
A lot was reported about this sphere in a really short amount of time. I'm not sure if the family reached out to reporters first, but somehow word got out. There's a weird ball in town. The local newspaper, The Florida Times-Union, has a folder full of articles about this ball, like a really thick folder. The earliest story I could find in their archive is dated April 11, headlined “Bizarre Sphere is Castle’s Latest Mystery Happening”— ‘castle’ because the family that found the sphere lived in a really big house. The photo accompanying the story is of 12-year-old Wayne. That's one of the family members. He's cupping his hand around the side of the sphere, kind of like it's a crystal ball or something.</p>
<p>This is what's in those first reports, what Ron knew before checking it out:</p>
<p>Terry Matthews is credited with finding the ball. He was a 21-year-old pre-med student with shoulder-length, dark hair, and a mustache curling down the sides of his lips. Depending on the article, it was late March early April when he went on a walk and found the sphere lying on the ground in the woods on his family's property in the Fort George Island area of Jacksonville, a place surrounded by the St. Johns River, some creeks and a lazy beach nearby, a pretty isolated area today — even more so back then. The family owned lots of land around there. So Terry brought it inside and didn't think much of it. Then some days after, there appeared to be more to the sphere. Terry's mom Gerri Betz ends up being the family spokesperson in all this, being the person who reporters interview. She's the matriarch of the Betz family, six kids and her husband Antoine, a marine engineer.</p>
<p>Gerri tells reporters the ball started vibrating some days after her son brought it inside, and when the ball was placed on a table, it would roll around the edges and wind up in in the middle, it was rolling in a straight line, it would suddenly veer. If someone rolled the ball, it would stop and return toward the person, only to stop a short distance from them and vibrate. Once, while a television crew was at the house, Gerri said the family's toy poodle was placed next to the ball to indicate its size, and the dog started whimpering and covering her ears with her paws.</p>
<p>Then somehow the Navy became interested in the ball and decided to examine it. If you're not familiar with Jacksonville, it's a pretty big military town. But this seems like a really big deal that the military would be concerned with the ball, which is one reason I'm so interested in the story. I don't know how it got on the Navy's radar. My best guess is all these news reports.</p>
<p>Then the same month, several UFO investigators got their hands on the ball too. Still, no one was able to ID it other than saying maybe it was a piece of industrial machinery. At least 26 unique stories about the ball were published across the country between April 1974 and October 1975, so it's not surprising Ron, that radio host, also wanted to take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“Here are some other photographs of it, and those are some photographs of UFOs I took out over the beach in Fernandina [trails off]”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
That was difficult to understand. He also brought along photos of some orbs in the sky. OK, so Ron is really into this stuff: UFOs, fantasy, sci-fi. He wrote two science fiction books, The Warrior King being his latest, and he even co-wrote the 1971 movie Zaat.</p>
<p><strong>[Zaat movie trailer:]
</strong>“One of the most incredible stories of modern time, Zaat. Invasion of the walking catfish.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Zaat was filmed partly in green Cove Springs, Florida. The trailer is on YouTube and it's pretty amazing.</p>
<p><strong>[Zaat movie trailer continues:]
</strong>“An entire town goes berserk in a rampage of death and violence.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Anyway, after Ron caught word of the ball from one of his callers, he contacted Gerri about wanting to take pictures of it. And she said, ‘All right, come over.’</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“The ball was sitting on a glass-top table in with no edge on it, you know, the glass was just a sheer-cut piece of glass. And I was really surprised, like you said, to see as many scratches on it. I was expecting this pristine looking, you know, thing like you see the science-fiction movies, but it looked like it was well used. And so we talked about it, and you know, how they found it, what, you know, all of those things. And I said, ‘Well, you know, I'd like to get some pictures of it.’ And I said, ‘Well, you know, let's go outside where we got plenty of good sunlight, and we'll find a place out there.’ So we all got up and started to go outside and I was the last one out. And as I was going out, the ball rolled from the center of the table, all the way to the edge. It stopped.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“And was that the first time you had seen it do anything to do anything?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“I hadn’t seen it do anything. And it was almost like, ‘Hey, don't forget me.’ So we picked it up, took it outside with us. You know, I heard about it moving. You know, they told me that it had moved across the carpet and things like that. But to think that it actually did that all by itself, and the fact that it didn't roll off of the edge of the table — you know, if somebody would have pushed it or nudged it or something like that, it would have gone all the way off.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“So when you held the ball, what were some characteristics that you personally experienced?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“First of all, the ball was heavy and when you when you held it, if you tilted it just a little bit one way or another, you can hear a very slight tinkle coming from inside the ball. If you've ever picked up a broken glass, like you break a glass in the kitchen and you you're picking up the pieces and you're throwing them back into the sink or something, you hear that little tinkle the glass makes? That's what it sounded like. It sounded like this little tinkling sound was coming from inside the ball.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Did it feel like anything was moving in there?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“I did not feel any movement.”</p>
<p><strong>[Archive news tape]</strong><br />
“…in the area north of Hecksher Drive in the Spring Hammock area. That was two weeks ago. Since then they've tried to find out what it is. There have been suggestions ranging from a giant ball bearing to an object from outer space.”</p>
<p><strong>[Gerri Betz in archive tape]
</strong>“I don't know. It probably has a very simple explanation. But so far, I haven't found anyone that can give me one.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
That's Gerri. After the news broke the Betz’s household phone was ringing at all hours. And a few of those calls were from Ron, the guy who took those pictures.</p>
<p><strong>[phone ringing]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
I guess this is what phones used to sound like.</p>
<p><strong>[Recorded phone call]</strong><br />
“…from WIVY…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Before Ron met with Gerri at her house, he interviewed her over the phone twice. Even with some serious restoration, these interviews are pretty hard to understand.</p>
<p>She tells Ron the ball is like a gyroscope, which is also what she tells news reporters. And my best description of a gyroscope is a spinning object that can appear to defy gravity and moves in interesting ways. Anyway, she says if you shake the ball vigorously and put it down, there's motion inside. And it sounds like when a defunct light bulb is shaken.</p>
<p>She says she was with her son Terry in the woods when he found the ball, and she doesn't remember if there was any marking or indentation on the ground beneath it because it was cold out, it started raining, they wanted to get back home. She said the ball’s vibrating and quivering started after about two weeks when Terry was tuning his guitar. She tells Ron she's in the process of getting the ball insured.</p>
<p>She said the scratches on the outside of the ball look like a starburst under a magnifying glass. There's also a little triangular-shaped chip out of the side of it, and the ball is magnetic.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Do you have a personal hypothesis of what the ball is?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“Over the years there have been other things that have come from UFO investigations that indicate that the alien people have a way of making these autonomous devices that can go out and gather information and then return and deposit that information somewhere else. And I believe that the ball was one of those kinds of devices.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Some people would think, well, you're you've been into this since you were a kid, you've written scripts. Like, you love this stuff. Does that influence, sort of, you know…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
This is me nervously asking Ron if his interest in UFOs and sci-fi means he's biased toward believing the sphere was a UFO.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“Yeah, yeah. I agree with their argument. I don't agree that is true. But I agree with where they were coming from.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“What would your response be to…?”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“— you weren't there. That's the biggest thing I could say. You weren't there. You didn't talk to these people. You can sit back in your, you know, overstuffed chair and surmise all you want. But have you ever seen one?”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“I want to point out here he's not saying the Betzes believe the ball was extraterrestrial. But he said his attitude on all of this goes back to when he was a kid living in rural Indiana.”</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“And you'd be in the feed store and you'd hear the farmers talking about, ‘Well, did you hear what happened last night?’ You know, ‘Did you see these things that were in the sky Wednesday night?’ you know, and stuff like this. And I knew most of those people. And they weren't the kind of people who were going to make up stories. They wanted to know what the hell was going on.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Ron believes he's pretty good at detecting BS because of the type of radio show he had. He said people would call in with made-up stories, and he could tell, but he didn't get that vibe from Gerri Betz or her family when they told him about the sphere’s strange behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Ron Kivett:</strong><br />
“I never got the feeling that they were being untruthful or that they were trying to pull my leg or anything like that. I never got the feeling that they weren't telling me the honest truth.”</p>
<p><strong>[music fades out]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Hello, Melissa.”</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Ross:</strong><br />
“Hi. Hey.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
So I started working on this podcast a couple summers ago. My coworker at WJCT, Melissa Ross, host of First Coast Connect, told me about the sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Ross:</strong><br />
“I was watching a show called Ancient Aliens one night with my kids.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Are you a big Ancient Aliens watcher?”</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Ross:</strong><br />
“I have watched it with my kids mainly. They like to watch it to make fun of it, and I find that really entertaining. And all of a sudden they started talking about this weird UFO case in Jacksonville, Florida, that involved this big, silver sphere. And I hadn't ever heard about it, which I thought was strange because I thought I knew all of the kinds of stories odd stories about Jacksonville, having lived here a while now, but I'd never heard of this.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Having lived in the area my whole life. I hadn't heard of it either. And neither had pretty much anyone else I asked. But some people do remember the stir it caused back then. A photo journalist at The Florida Times-Union newspaper, Lou Egner, was assigned the story. He's since passed away, but I got in touch with his daughter, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“Even as a teenager, I would not have missed dinner because he always had something to say if, if not to bring home somebody to join us for dinner, quite often a celebrity. So it was really an interesting life as a kid of a photojournalist, what kind of celebrities — he brought Bob Hope home and Johnny Carson and Lee Trevino and…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Wait, what? Really?”</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“At that time he was the head of the photography department, so he was in charge of celebrities, and my dad felt that anybody would want to come home and eat my mother's cooking.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Susan's dad is actually quoted in a few articles about the sphere as being a witness to its strange behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“I must have been home visiting. And that's how I must have heard about it is when I was home, and probably my sister was there at the same time because she still lived in Jacksonville. And we do remember hearing about how it moved in different directions, and then came back. We do remember that.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“And do you remember your dad saying that he personally witnessed it?”</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
In a Palm Beach Post story headlined “Mystery Sphere a Bug from Outer Space?” it said Lou Egner showed up to the family's home on assignment, skeptical. “I'm leery of this kind of thing.” he's quoted saying. “When I got there, Mrs. Betz said, ‘You won't believe this if you don't see it.’ She told me to put it on the floor and give it a push. It rolled away and stopped. So what? She said, ‘Just wait a minute.’ It turned around and rolled to the left about 8 feet, made a big arc and came right back to my feet.”</p>
<p>In a Florida Times-Union article, Lou describes the ball as “the darndest thing I ever saw. It seems to have a life of its own.” The next day the paper published another story headlined “Odd Ball Remains Mystery” where it claims its photographer Lou Egner watched the ball go through a series of weird wanderings, seeming to move on its own and also halting and vibrating.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Do these all sound like things he said about it?”</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“Yep. And where he said, ‘It's the darndest thing I ever saw,’ that sounds like him. Him saying he was ‘leery,’ That's an odd word that I guess he might have used if he's been quoted there. But when you said, ‘It the darndest thing I ever saw,’ that sounds exactly like my dad.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“And you said he's curious, but… is he the kind of person who would just sort of buy into the fun of this or do you think he really felt like, ‘Well, this is very weird.’”</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“Well, that's kind of a tricky question, because my dad was really full of — he was sort of mischievous. He loved things that were intriguing. So I'm sure that he would be totally intrigued by something like this.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“And so did you believe him? That he saw it do these things?”</p>
<p><strong>Susan Egner:</strong><br />
“Yeah, why wouldn't I? He wouldn't fabricate a story because he has too many real stories that you can tell. So I don't think he would fabricate something. He obviously witnessed it.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
After the break, one of the Betz family members sends me an email.</p>
<p><strong>[Promo:]</strong><br />This podcast is made possible by supporters of WJCT Public Media with additional support from Bold Bean Coffee Roasters. Eight years ago, Erin Lee saw a new coffee shop was opening up in Jacksonville and she applied.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Lee:</strong><br />I just have always gravitated towards people. Getting to be the start of someone's day has always been fulfilling for me, for people to have a good cup of coffee and a good experience first thing in the morning. I think that there's a lot of value in that.</p>

<p><strong>[music fades out]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
When I started reporting this story, my first thought was to Google Gerri's name and call her up. But I found out pretty quick, that's not so easy, because the family doesn't like talking about the ball and all the stress and chaos it caused in their lives. I reached out to one of Gerri's adult grandkids.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“I’m just gonna pull up the email. The email said that throughout their life, Gerri's side of the family, they would joke about aliens and a space ball. But then the kids just thought OK, maybe this is an extremely specific inside joke.”</p>
<p><strong>Al Pete:</strong><br />
“So they would just accept it?”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
That's podcasting intern Al Pete, who is helping me produce this.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Kind of. When the family was asked about it, they'd laugh and they'd say, ‘Oh, it's nothing.’ But a few years ago, this person’s sister did some researching online and found all of these articles about the sphere. So the sister was in her early 30s and this other sibling, in their mid 20s.</p>
<p><strong>Al Pete:</strong><br />
“How did that go?”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“The family member was dumbfounded, really shocked. And they did ask their parents about it. One of the aunts was the only person who would sort of get into this, but then she didn't give I guess much detailed information about it. So the end of the email is saying, ‘My family frowns upon lying. I'm a very skeptical person, but I also know they couldn't make it up. And to me, it’s just really difficult to ascertain what happened because no one is willing to discuss what happened, not even if you’re family.’ So then they just wish me luck with the podcast.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
I followed up asking, would you be willing to do an interview and come in?</p>
<p><strong>Al Pete:</strong><br />
“So are they going to do the interview?”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“I got a yes response. But then I was pretty much ghosted.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
This didn't totally surprise me. Because even though Gerri is quoted in dozens of articles, all those interviews stopped after about a year, and the rest of the family followed suit. Even the Ancient Aliens episode on the History Channel lacked input from Terry, who found the sphere, or his mom, Gerri. They instead interviewed a family friend, Dick Burnett.</p>
<p><strong>[Sound of driving]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />“Keep going this way. It’s going to be up on the right side of that…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
I went to Dick's Jacksonville home back in 2017 when I was working on the story on my own time with my friend Nyah, so you're going to hear him talking.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />[in car] “It’s that two-story I think on the right…” [In living room] “This is awesome!]
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Also, Dick’s living room literally looks like a museum, complete with glass cases of artifacts and antlers on the wall. And so. Many. fossils.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“He became extinct 15,000 years ago. That’s called an Irish elk. He got the largest antlers of any animal that ever lived.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
— which are on the wall. Dick fell into sculpting missing pieces of fossilized skeletons and has naturally wound up with his own collection.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“We reconstructed two sets of antlers, one for the Smithsonian.” “This is a mastodon that we put together for the University of Florida. He's in the newspaper there.” “This is the largest jaw, we built a jaw with these megalodon teeth.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
This part of the tour goes on for about 18 minutes…</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“… a woolly mammoth tooth down there…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
But eventually, we get to why we paid the visit.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“All right, I'm gonna tell you what I know, which is not a whole lot. The History Channel called me and asked me if they could interview me about the metallic ball, the Betz ball. And I said, ‘No, I won't do it, but I'll call Gerri Betz and see what she says about it, you know, what she wants.’ And of course I called Gerri. She's a friend. Haven't seen her in a while, but we talk. And she says, ‘Dick,’ she says, ‘I don't want to talk to anybody any more about it,’ but she says, ‘I would like you to do the interview.’</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Back in April 1974. Dick says Gerri Betz invited him and his wife, Joan, and their three kids to come over to their castle mansion house and check out this ball they'd found.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“We went out that day. And she brought the ball out, and it was a metallic silver ball, fairly heavy, about this big around, maybe a little larger than a bowling ball, maybe the same size, right in there somewhere. And she put it on the floor. And we started talking, and the kids were kind of playing with it. And I walked outside with Gerri. And so the kids told me later that — [Dick’s son] Tommy Burnett, he said, ‘Dad, when I walked, it followed me.’ This is what he said. And, of course, it’s this little kid this big saying all this and everything.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
His son Tom was about 10 or 11 at the time. The Betz kids got a mayonnaise lid out, which would magnetically stick to some areas of the ball but not others. Then, he said, a family member walked past the ball and it followed them. They took a few steps, and it turned and rolled behind them to a stop.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“I called Gerri and said, before I did this interview, I asked her, ‘Can you kind of go through a brief synopsis of everything, you know, they're going to ask me?’ And she bought some land…”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
Dick rattles off a lot of what we already know: Terry initially brought the ball inside as a novelty item, just kind of a neat thing he found.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“And he put it on his table next to his bed there, and he got up one day a few days later and was strumming his guitar. And it started kind of humming at him.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
The ball would vibrate. They felt like there was a hollow spot inside.</p>
<p>Shortly after the ball’s discovery, the Navy picked it up to investigate it. And again, I don't know exactly what the military was testing for. I've been unsuccessful in locating an official report. But one article said the ball peaked the Navy's interest. At the time, Gerri said she made sure to get a contract with the Navy. The deal was they had two weeks to investigate it and if it can't be identified as government property, the Betz family gets it back. And she expected a comprehensive report.</p>
<p>Here's what was in the news around that time:</p>
<p><strong>[archive news tape]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Male announcer:]</strong><br />
“The Navy x-rayed the ball but that didn't help.”</p>
<p><strong>[Navy spokesman:]</strong><br />
“It wasn't powerful enough to penetrate the ball.”</p>
<p><strong>[Male announcer:]</strong><br />
“You've been able to determine several factors about the ball. You felt that it’s magnetic?”</p>
<p><strong>[Navy spokesman:]</strong><br />
“Yes, sir. It has a strong indication that there is quite a lot of magnetism in it.”</p>
<p><strong>[Male announcer:]</strong><br />
“What would this indicate?”</p>
<p><strong>[Navy spokesman:]</strong><br />
“Well it would indicate that the ball is some sort of steel.”</p>
<p><strong>[Male announcer:]</strong><br />
“Do you have any theories as to what it might be?”</p>
<p><strong>[Navy spokesman:]</strong><br />
“Not really. To me, it just appears to be a real well-balanced ball.”</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“The day that they brought it back —”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
— they being the Navy —</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“It was an officer, an enlisted man or something like that, a couple of people I believe. And while the man from the Navy was out there, he received a phone call where they wanted it back. This is, I'm telling you, this is what I heard.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
So what he's saying is the Navy called the Betz house asking for the officer who was delivering the ball and told him not to return it to the Betz family.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“Gerri at the time, I believe, said, ‘No, we'll keep it.” Then, some people in South Florida somewhere, some scientists or something, asked to look at it. Gerri sent Terry and Robin, her two sons, to fly down there with it. And they were going to fly back with it. Well, the people sent the two boys back and kept the ball. And that I don't think that was the way it was supposed to work. But they finally got the ball back. And there was a pretty well-known professor. He asked permission to come and see the ball and sleep with it. And so he came down and slept with the ball.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“Just, like, next to him?”</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“I wasn't there. I don't think they got married.” [laughter]
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
OK, what? So this is the first time I'm hearing about this professor and people from South Florida. I am just as confused as you are at this point. Dick was the very first person I interviewed. And this is the moment I'm starting to think, OK, this story is a lot more than just a weird ball. Anyway, back to Dick.</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“They won't they won't talk to anybody anymore about it.”</p>
<p><strong>Nyah:</strong><br />“Do you remember what the vibe was like for the family, the friends around the time they discovered the ball?”</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“It was probably at that point a little exciting for them. And it went on so long, there was so much going on, the ball went back and forth. And then at the end, they weren't sure that they got the right ball back even. You know, because people had it, you know, and everything. And so, and, you know, the History Channel asked me where the ball is now, I says, ‘I don't know.’ I said, ‘You may not ever see it again,’ You know, I don't know. So that's what she told me.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
“That we may never know or that she doesn't know?”</p>
<p><strong>Dick Burnett:</strong><br />
“I don't question her too tightly on that. I don't know if she’s just had the course. You know, after a while people will say you're crazy or this or that. But she is not. She was excited to try to find out where it came from. That's why she went to these different people to see if, you know, if there's a possibility that it came from somewhere else besides Earth. I think after a while a lot of people throw accusations: ‘It's not true. It's not real.’ It probably isn’t. I don't know for sure. You know, I can't say. I I'm a friend of the whole Betz family, every single one of them and there were several. And I know they wouldn't turn around and lie or anything like that.”</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Kilbride:</strong><br />
But even though Dick says the Navy tried to keep the Betz ball, that's not what was reported. This was:</p>
<p>The Navy was able to take an x-ray with a more powerful machine. And according to lots of news reports, this is what it found: The ball was about 22 pounds and 8 inches in diameter. The Navy couldn't determine exactly where the ball came from but concluded it was made out of common stainless steel 431 and definitely made on Earth. The tiny beads of material rolling around inside? Probably from the manufacturing process. And though the Navy spokesman said, “There's certainly something odd about it,” and that it did move at the house, he also said, “I believe it's because of the construction of the house. It's old and it has uneven floors.” He said the ball is so balanced, it takes just an indentation to make it move or change direction.</p>
<p>So that's the official explanation and pretty much the end of the story, right? Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>[creepy music under clips]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified woman:]</strong><br />
“Her son and another family member drove it to this panel of scientists in New Orleans.”</p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified man:]</strong><br />
“I really enjoyed my work on the panel.”</p>
<p><strong>[Newscaster:]</strong><br />
“Professor Hynek returned yesterday from New Orleans after sharing observations with colleagues regarding the so-called ‘mystery sphere.’ Do you consider this now extraterrestrial or Earth manufactured?”</p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified man:]</strong><br />
“Are you are you insinuating, Lindsey, that my father is some sort of UFO kleptomaniac?”</p>
<p><strong>[Lindsey in the car:]</strong><br />
“We're trying to find this mansion that’s back here somewhere.”</p>
